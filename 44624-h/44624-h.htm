<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

<p>The kingdom of Sweden occupies the eastern and larger
part of the Scandinavian peninsula, covering an area of one
hundred and seventy thousand six hundred and sixty square
miles, with a population of somewhat more than five millions.
Sweden is of nearly the same width, from east to
west, throughout her whole length. If the country were
divided into four equal parts, the southernmost part would
correspond to the district of Gothaland, the next to the district
of Svealand, consisting of most of what is north of the
lakes Venar and Vetter and what is south of the Dal River,
while the two remaining parts together would make up the
district of Norrland. Gothaland, in ancient times called
<i>Sunnanskogs</i> (South of the Woods), consists of the old
provinces Scania, Bleking, Smaland and East Gothland
by the Baltic, Halland and Bohuslæn by the North Sea,
and West Gothland of the interior. Svealand, or <i>Nordanskogs</i>,
consists of the provinces Sœdermanland and Upland
by the Baltic, south and north of Lake Mælar, respectively,
Dal, Vermland and Dalecarlia on the Norwegian frontier,
and Nerike and Westmanland of the interior. Norrland
consists of the provinces of Gestrikland, Helsingland, Medelpad,
Angermanland and Westerbotten by the Gulf of
Bothnia, a branch of the Baltic, and Herjedal, Jemtland
and the Lapmark on the Norwegian frontier. A great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
number of islands form part of the kingdom, of which the
two largest, Gothland and Œland, are situated in the Baltic.
One-twelfth of the area, or as much as the whole
state of Denmark, consists of water.</p>

<p>Sweden is politically united with Norway and ruled by
the same king, these united kingdoms forming the largest
realm in Europe next to Russia, Sweden herself ranking
as the sixth in size.</p>

<p>Sweden is a country which offers striking varieties in
scenery and conditions. In the southernmost province of
Scania, an ancient home of culture, the nightingale and the
stork dwell in the fertile plains, and the walnut, mulberry
and chestnut trees render ripening fruit. Central Sweden
is a wooded plateau, rich in rocky hills and inland seas.
Although barren lands occupy large areas, these parts are
characterized by a loveliness and picturesqueness which
are still more pronounced in the northern provinces along
the coast. Only in the inner mountainous regions of Norrland
is the scenery of real grandeur where the white-capped
giants appear in vast groups, or in isolated peaks of six
thousand to seven thousand feet in altitude, where a hundred
glaciers with glacier rivers, moraines and erosions
cover a surface almost as large as the glaciers of Tyrol,
and where, in the turbulent course of mighty rivers, are
formed tremendous waterfalls, one of them, The Hare’s
Leap, being the largest in Europe.</p>

<p>Geologically considered, Sweden is situated around the
centre of the ancient Scandinavian land-ice, and in the
greater part of the country only two of the geological
series, the oldest and the youngest, are represented. Thus
the uneven, undulating surface of the Archæan rocks, on
which almost the whole country is firmly set, is in general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
covered with quaternary deposits of gravel and clay. The
mountains are rich in iron ore, the streams and lakes in
fish, the woods in game, but the soil, itself of a good quality,
unfortunately rich in stones. This last-mentioned circumstance,
together with the rather severe climate, which
yet is a good deal milder than might be expected, especially
in the southern and western parts of the country, makes
agriculture, which is the most important industry, profitable
only on the extensive plains of Scania, Upland and
West and East Gothland. Still barley and rye are cultivated
within the Polar Circle, ripening in remarkably
short time under the nocturnal light of the Midsummer
sun. Dense forests cover Sweden in the very
same latitude in which Greenland is clad by eternal
ice. The short summers are of a surpassing loveliness.
In Norrland there is a Swedish <i>læn</i>, or governmental
district, of the size of the State of Ohio, on
which, between the 5th of June and the 11th of July, the
sun never sets. If the earth was perfectly plain and even
one would be able to see the sun above the horizon continually
during this period. But these northerly regions are
very mountainous, and consequently you will have to climb
a high peak in order to see the wonderful sight of a sun
which stands still when it should set, and which marks
the difference between night and day only by a rolling
motion in the horizon. There is no country in the world
where so many places for such observation are reached
so easily as in Sweden. One may travel the whole distance
from the southernmost point of the country to the very base
of a mountain, Gellivara, Sweden’s Klondike, from which
the midnight sun can be seen for thirty-seven nights in
succession. But although the sun itself is visible only from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
the mountain peaks above the Polar Circle, the nocturnal
light steeps the whole realm in midsummer-night’s dreams
of magic colors and reflections.</p>

<p>The Swedish people are of Teutonic stock and have
lived in the land they still inhabit for at least four thousand
years, during this entire period not having assimilated
other nationalities, or at least to no extent worth mentioning,
so that the Swedish nation is of an origin far purer
than any other at present existing.</p>

<p>The kingdom of Sweden is the most ancient of the states
still extant in Europe, for all historical monuments prove
that the Swedes have kept to about their present territory,
perfectly independent of foreign nations, probably for a long
time divided into lesser communities, but for the past twelve
hundred years united in one single realm. The languages
spoken in the Scandinavian North belong to the Teutonic
family of Indo-European languages, and seem to have been
one and almost homogeneous up to the time of the Viking
Age (about 700-1060), when various dialects commence to
be distinguished. The old uniform language has been
preserved in Northern loanwords in the Finnish and Lap
languages and in about one hundred of the oldest Runic inscriptions.
The early Old Swedish, from the Viking Age to
somewhat later than 1200, did not differ much from the
Old Norse (the Old Norwegian and Old Icelandic), while
the difference from the Old Danish was almost imperceptible.
The sources for the study of this language period are
about two thousand later Runic inscriptions and nearly one
hundred Old Swedish loanwords, almost all proper names,
in the Russian language. The classical period of Old Swedish
falls between 1200 and about 1350. Its most important
monuments are the provincial laws and a manuscript collec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>tion
of saintly legends, called Codex Bureanus. The language
of this period offers a number of dialects, of which
only one, the Gutnic, is strictly defined. In the next period
of Old Swedish, from 1350 to the Reformation, a universal
language for the whole country is distinguished. The so-called
Oxenstiern manuscripts and Codex Bildstenianus are
the chief sources of our knowledge of this language period,
mostly of religious contents. Modern Swedish dates from
the Reformation, its later period being counted from the
publication of the state law in 1734. The Swedish language
seems to be based chiefly upon the dialect of Sœdermanland,
with influences from other dialects. Among the Scandinavian
languages, Swedish ranks next to the Icelandic in point
of purity, and is the foremost of them all in point of beauty.</p>

<p>The Swedes are a hardworking, industrious and intelligent
race, not fully conscious of their own rich endowment
and slow to push their individual claims. In moments of
danger and distress, this people give evidence of an active
heroism, which offers a great contrast to their usual quiet
and peaceful demeanor. The Swedish nation is endowed
with an unusual inventive power, which has placed it in
the first rank of scientific research, having produced a quota
of initiative spirits, as originators, founders and innovators
of sciences, which is considerably larger than that of any
other modern country, in proportion to the population. The
national temperament is, like the soil, composed of extremes.
With the serene quiet and almost sullen tranquillity goes a
patience of extraordinary endurance which, when it gives
in, surprises by the passion which takes its place. To the
melancholy trait in the Swedish character is contrasted a
great desire for the pleasures of life and exuberant animal
spirits. Under a quiet surface, the Swede conceals a rapid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
comprehension and an almost morbid sensitiveness, sometimes
causing people of other nationalities to judge him
slow of intellect or perfidious, when he is only slow of action
or indisposed to show his feelings. The most valuable
inheritance from his ancestors is his moral courage, while
the ancient Northern trait of self-restraint is often carried
to an extreme. Akin to both is his dignity. He possesses
great musical and improvisatorial gifts which complete his
lyric-rhetorical temperament.</p>

<p>There are some 6,000 Laplanders and some 20,000 Finns
living in the furthest North, and foreigners to the number
of about 20,000 dwell in Sweden, mostly Norwegians, Finns
and Danes. More than 99 per cent of the population consists
of native Swedes, and 99.9 per cent belong to the
Lutheran state church or the Protestant denominations.</p>

<p>The principal towns are Stockholm, the capital, with
300,000 inhabitants, enchantingly beautiful in situation, on
the mainland and islands at the outlet of Lake Mælar into
the Baltic; Gothenburg, with 120,000 inhabitants, the chief
commercial centre, at the mouth of the Gotha River, by
the North Sea; Malmœ, with 60,000 inhabitants, in Scania,
by the Sound. The university towns of Upsala, in Upland,
and Lund, in Scania, have 25,000 and 17,000 inhabitants,
respectively.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Sweden in Prehistoric and Early Historic Times&mdash;Archæological
Finds and Classical Testimony</i></span></h2>

<p>The Swedes, although the oldest and most unmixed
race in Europe, realized very late the necessity of
writing chronicles or reviews of historic events.
Thus the names of heroes and kings of the remotest past
are helplessly forgotten, and lost also the history of its
earliest religion and institutions.</p>

<p>But Mother Earth has carefully preserved most of what
has been deposited in her bosom, and has repaid diligent
research with trustworthy and irrefutable accounts of the
age and various degrees of civilization of the race which
inhabited Sweden in prehistoric times. Thus it has been
proved that Sweden, like most other countries, has had a
Stone Age, a Bronze Age, and an Iron Age. But there is
absolutely no evidence to prove the now antiquated theories
of various immigrations into Sweden by different races on
different stages of civilization. On the contrary, the graves
from the remotest times, through all successive periods,
prove by the form of the skulls of those buried in them that
Sweden has, through all ages, been inhabited by the same
dolichocephalic, or long-headed, race which constitutes the
overwhelming majority of her people to-day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>Sweden, physically considered, is not of as high antiquity
as some countries of Europe. Yet it has been
inhabited during the last four thousand years, at least.
In the quaternary period the Scandinavian peninsula was
a centre of a glacial movement which spread its disastrous
influences over Western Russia, Northern Germany and
Holland. In that period no vegetable or animal life was
possible in Sweden. From the fact that the earliest stone
celts found in Sweden and Denmark are not polished, archæologists
were led to suppose that the Stone Age of the
North was contemporaneous with the Palæolithic civilization
in Western Europe. But this standpoint has been
found untenable, because it has later become evident that
the fauna surrounding the earliest inhabitants of the
Northern countries was ours and not a quaternary one.</p>

<p>The oldest types of finds of <i>the Stone Age</i> in the North
have been discovered in the refuse-heaps on the Danish
coast. These refuse-heaps, consisting of stone implements,
shells, bones, etc., do not occur in Sweden, but the implements
characteristic of them are found scattered over some
parts of the southernmost Swedish province of Scania. The
shape of these earliest finds is exactly the same as of those
of the later Stone Age, the only difference being that the
former are not polished. But there are transitions between
the classes, and the act of polishing must be regarded as an
important phase of progress.</p>

<p>The Stone Age of Sweden is quite remarkable. If the
remains of the earlier period are scanty, the finds from the
later one are all the more numerous. With the exception
of Denmark and a part of North Germany, there is no European
country which can boast of such rich and beautiful
relics from the later Stone Age as the southern part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Sweden. The finds in the other countries mentioned are
almost exactly like those of Sweden from the Stone and the
Bronze Ages, both as far as implements and skulls are concerned,
proving them to have been settled by the same race.</p>

<p>The weapons and implements from the Stone Age consist
of axes, daggers, spearheads, arrowheads, saws, and
knives of flint; axes, gauges, handmills of stone; fishhooks
and arrowheads of bone; earthenware, etc., etc. The graves
of this period are dolmens, passage-graves, and stone cists,
the last mentioned either uncovered or covered with a barrow.
The different forms of burial places seem to indicate
four successive stages of the period. Through their existence
it becomes probable that the inhabitants of Sweden
during the Stone Age had fixed dwelling places.</p>

<p>A dolmen is a grave-chamber of which the walls are
formed of large, thick stones set up edgewise, covered with
one huge block of stone as a roof, all the stones being rough
outside and smooth inside. The passage-graves are built
in the same way, but are larger and distinguished by a long
covered passage leading to it. These graves are surrounded
by a low barrow, upon the top of which the huge roof-stones
were originally visible. Dolmens and passage-graves occur
in Sweden in considerable numbers along the coast of
Scania, on the plains of West Gothland and in Bohuslæn,
more sparsely in other parts of West Gothland and in Halland,
with stray cases of graves of a similar construction
in Nerike and Western Sœdermanland. It is important to
note the regions in which these graves have been found, for
they must be identical with the parts of the earliest settlements.
Such graves are also very common in Denmark,
while only one has been found in Norway.</p>

<p>The stone cists resemble very much the chamber of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
passage-grave. They are larger and four-sided, and built
of somewhat thinner stones. Stone cists standing partly
visible above the barrow constitute a form peculiar to
Sweden, occurring in great numbers in West Gothland,
Bohuslæn, Dalsland and Southwestern Vermland, while
the covered stone cists appear in the same provinces and
in Nerike, East Gothland, Smaland, Bleking and the Island
of Gothland.</p>

<p>During the Stone Age the bodies were buried unburned,
in a recumbent or sitting position. By the side of the dead
body was usually placed a weapon, a tool, or some ornaments,
sometimes also earthenware vessels, now filled only
with earth. These vessels may once have contained food.
The elaborate graves seem to indicate a belief in a future
life. The food, if any such was placed by the side of the
dead, would not necessarily point to the fact that such a
future life was imagined merely as a continuation of earth
life. The heathen Scandinavians of a later age believed
that the dead remained for some time in their burial place
before reaching their ultimate destination. For their possible
wants during this intermediate state food was left
with the dead body.</p>

<p>The total number of relics of stone found in Sweden is
64,000. Of these only 4,000 belong to Svealand and Norrland,
while of all the rest found in Gothaland 45,000 belong
to Scania alone.</p>

<p>In a much later age the Scandinavians were regarded
as pure barbarians. For this reason it is important to observe
that graves from the Stone Age show that the Swedes
in that remote period had several domesticated animals,
the dog, horse, ox, swine, sheep, and, perhaps, also the
goat. Hence they were certainly a pastoral people, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
living exclusively by hunting and fishing. But whether
they practiced agriculture cannot be decided in the present
state of our knowledge. The fact that the very oldest
graves are found in the most fertile districts of Southern
Sweden seems to speak in favor of the supposition that
agriculture was known and appreciated.</p>

<p>Of metals, even of gold, the people of the late Stone
Age were entirely ignorant, also of the art of writing.
Hence no monuments of their language will ever be found.
Still it is highly probable that the Teutonic ancestors of the
Swedes began to settle in the land from the beginning of
the Stone Age.</p>

<p>It is true that some skulls, very much like those of the
Laps, have also been found in the graves of the Stone Age;
but it must be borne in mind that these burial places, impressive
through their size and the amount of work and
mechanical skill necessary for their erection, can be believed
to have been originally intended only for kings or chieftains,
and their families. It was probably a custom, as
in later heathen times, to bury with such distinguished
people a number of slaves, dead or alive. The presence of
skulls of a non-Scandinavian type can thus be explained,
without the necessity of accepting the theory of an early
mixture of two races.</p>

<p>In the northern part of Sweden have been found relics
of stone, usually of slate, which do not appear to have
belonged to the people of the dolmens or passage-graves.
They bear a close resemblance to those found in Finland
and in other countries inhabited by Laps, Finns and peoples
related to them. This seems to prove that these so-called
Arctic stone implements are relics of the Laps and
belong to the time when this people was still ignorant of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the use of metal. Judging from the number of relics
found on the coast, from Westerbotten to Gestrikland, and
in Dalecarlia, the Laps dwelt also in somewhat more southerly
parts of Sweden than at the present day. So far south
as in the middle provinces, no Arctic stone relics have been
found, still less in any of the southern provinces. This
seems to indicate that the Laps and the Swedes did not
dwell in the same parts of the country during the Stone
Age, and their intercourse, if any, must have been of a
very accidental and casual nature.</p>

<p>That the Stone Age lasted a very long time in the
North is proved by the fact that it reached a far higher
development there than anywhere else in Europe. The
best authorities think that it must have ended rather
before than after 1500 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, or 3,500 years before our
time.</p>

<p><i>The Bronze Age</i> followed upon the Stone Age. Flint
exists in Sweden and was easily found. There are also
copper mines, but their working is of comparatively modern
date. The copper of the Bronze Age must have been
brought from abroad, and tin, necessary for the production
of bronze, is foreign to Scandinavia. The knowledge of
the working of any metal proves an immense progress.
Yet there are strong grounds for the opinion that the beginning
of the Bronze Age in Sweden was not connected
with any great immigration of a new race, but that the
inhabitants learned the art of working bronze by intercourse
with other nations. The resemblance of the graves
during the last part of the Stone Age and the early part
of the Bronze Age points most strongly to such a conclusion.
From Asia the knowledge of bronze, and the higher
civilization dependent on it, had gradually spread itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
over the continent of Europe, in a northerly and northwesterly
direction, until it reached the coasts of the Baltic.</p>

<p>The Bronze Age of Sweden began about 1500 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, and
lasted for a thousand years, or until the beginning of the
fifth century before Christ. The period has been divided
into an Earlier and a Later Bronze Age, a division which
has been questioned as to its absolute correctness. The
works from the former are decorated with fine spiral ornaments
and zigzag lines. The graves generally contain remains
of unburned bodies. The antiquities of the Earlier
Bronze Age, almost without an exception, appear to be of
native workmanship. They are distinguished by artistic
forms and point to a highly developed taste in the working
of bronze. They generally surpass in this respect the
relics of the Bronze Age found in almost all other European
countries. The works belonging to the Later Bronze
Age are characterized by a very different taste and style
of ornamentation, though even they are often the result
of great skill. The spiral ornaments are no longer predominant,
but the ends of rings, knife-handles, and the
like, are often rolled up in spiral volutes.</p>

<p>During this period the dead were always burned. Buttons,
sword-hilts, and other works of bronze were sometimes
decorated with pieces of amber and resin inlaid.
Objects are also often found overlaid with thin plates of
gold.</p>

<p>Remarkable are the rock-carvings from this period.
The Swedes of the Bronze Age understood, by a kind of
picture-writing, how to preserve the memory of important
events, although an alphabet of any kind was unknown.
The rock-carvings have been found abundantly in Bohuslæn
(formerly a part of West Gothland) and East Goth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>land,
but also occur in Scania and other parts of Sweden.
At the time of the arrival of Cortez in Mexico the Aztecs
were exactly on the same standpoint. In spite of their
high civilization, they were in the Bronze Age and possessed
a picture-writing, but were not acquainted with
an alphabet. In Sweden, as in Mexico, there certainly
once existed an oral tradition necessary for its interpretation,
which, now lost, leaves little hope for their present
or future explanation. Yet they throw considerable light
on Swedish civilization during this remote period. Thus
they show that horses were already used for riding and
driving. Cattle are represented. In pairs these are harnessed
to a plow, which is being driven by a man.
Boats are depicted, generally very large ones, without
masts, but with thirty pairs of oars or more. They are
usually unlike at the two ends, sometimes adorned with
an animal’s head in the high and narrow stem, sometimes
with a similar decoration also in the stern.</p>

<p>The rock-carvings tell us nothing of the dwellings or
the dress of the Swedes in the Bronze Age. All the instruments
and tools necessary for the construction of wooden
houses existed and appear to have been in use. The material
was ever abundantly supplied by the Swedish forests,
but it was not strong enough to withstand the influence
of time. All the more surprising it is that articles of dress
from such a remote period as the Earlier Bronze Age, 1000
<span class="small">B.C.</span>, should have been preserved to our time. Still such
is the case, thanks to a combination of exceptionally favorable
circumstances. These garments are of wool of a very
simple substance; some have been worn by men, others
by women. The man’s dress consisted of an unbrimmed
cap of thick woven wool, a wide circular mantle, a kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
of tunic, kept together with a woollen belt, and some narrow
strips of wool which probably covered the legs. In a
man’s grave was found a shawl of wool with fringes. The
woman’s dress consisted then, as it does now, chiefly of
two garments, a jacket with sleeves and a long robe, the
latter held together with a belt of wool, ending in ornamental
tassels. Large mantles, of mixed wool and cow
hair, were used as wraps. The women wore splendid
bronze ornaments, such as finger-rings, bracelets, torques
and brooches. From the finds it becomes apparent that
many women in those days carried weapons, a dagger
often being found at the side of the body.</p>

<p>Besides swords and axes of beautiful workmanship, fishhooks,
sickles and the different parts of harness have been
found; also vessels of gold or bronze, evidently used for
temple service. The Swedes of the Bronze Age were not
acquainted with the art of forging the heated metal, but
they possessed much technical skill in the art of casting.
When the implement was taken out of the mold it was
dipped in cold water, and very often the surface was ornamented
by means of punches made of bronze. Their good
taste was as highly developed as their skill. That the work
was done in the North is proven by numerous finds of the
very molds in which weapons and agricultural implements
were cast. During the Stone Age only Gothaland and parts
of Svealand were inhabited. The finds of the Bronze Age
prove that the limits of the population were about the same
during this period. The southern provinces continued to
be the more thickly settled. Twenty times as many finds
have been made in the soil of Scania as in the rest of the
country. Norrland was hardly settled to any extent until
the Iron Age, and has offered comparatively few finds from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the Bronze Age, the total of which for the whole of Sweden
amounts to about 4,000.</p>

<p><i>The Iron Age</i> followed upon the Bronze Age. It lasts
to this very day, we ourselves still living in the Iron Age;
but the term is generally applied to that part of the period
which commences with the close of the Bronze Age, and
ends with the fall of heathendom. During the Iron Age,
the Swedes first became acquainted with iron, silver, brass,
lead, glass, stamped coins from foreign lands, and learned
how to solder and gild metal. Archæologists have divided
the period into two main parts, the Earlier and the Later
Iron Age, both with subdivisions. The Earlier Iron Age
includes the time from the fifth century <span class="small">B.C.</span> to about
the beginning of the fifth century <span class="small">A.D.</span> The first half
of the Earlier Iron Age is characterized by swords with
both blades and sheaths made of iron, thin crescent-shaped
knives, brooches of iron, collars, and decorative plates overlaid
with bronze. The graves resemble those from the end
of the Bronze Age, containing burned bones in urns, or laid
together in a heap. This circumstance makes it more than
probable that the first introduction of iron in the North was
not connected with any immigration of a new people. The
finds of the earliest Iron Age are not very rich, but they
prove that the people who have left them behind had been
subjected to a very strong influence from the Gallic tribes
living close to the south of the Teutonic area of population.
Then came the second half of the Earlier Iron Age, characterized
by a strong Roman influence. It commences with
the extension of the Roman empire toward the North, about
the beginning of the Christian era, and winds up with the
beginning of the fifth century, when Teutonic migrations
and invasions put an end to the power of Rome. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
hostile or friendly relations between Romans and Teutons
the Swedes were not involved. But by the peaceful ways
of commerce the influence of Rome penetrated to the people
of the North. Great numbers of Roman coins have
been found in Sweden, and also vessels of bronze and glass,
weapons, etc., as well as works of art, all turned out of
workshops in Rome or its provinces. Out of about 4,760
Roman coins of this time found in Sweden, no less than
4,000 were found in the remarkable Island of Gothland, in
the southern half of the Baltic, 90 in the neighboring island
of Œland, 650 in Scania, but only 23 on the mainland of
Sweden, excluding Scania. About 250 were found in
Bornholm, 600 in Denmark, but only 3 in Norway. It
becomes evident from these finds that there existed a regular
traffic over the Baltic, through Germany, between
the Island of Gothland and the Roman provinces, from
the epoch of the Marcomannic war down to the time of
Septimius Severus. Similar finds have been made on the
southern shore of the Baltic, showing that the traffic
came from the southeast, along the valleys of the Vistula
and the Oder.</p>

<p>One of the most important discoveries of this period was
the art of writing, which the inhabitants of the North seem
to have acquired soon after the beginning of the Christian
era. The earliest alphabetic symbols in Sweden, and the
only ones used there during the whole of heathen times, were
<i>runes</i>. These were probably invented a little before the
Christian era by a South Teutonic tribe, in imitation of the
Roman writing which the Teutons received from one of the
Celtic tribes living just to the north of the Alps. The Roman
characters were adapted for the use of inscriptions in
stone and wood, the curves being changed into straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
lines. The Runic characters, in use among all Teutonic
tribes, were twenty-four in number; these older runes
were, by the Scandinavians, later simplified and reduced
to sixteen. There is a number of inscriptions in older runes
in Sweden, dating from about 300 to 500 <span class="small">A.D.</span> They are
found chiefly on stones and gold bracteates, also in England,
France, Germany, Wallachia and the west of Russia.
All belong to about the same date, and are of Teutonic
origin. The early Runic inscriptions do not contain any
accounts of historically known persons or events. Yet they
are of the greatest historical importance, for they show that
during the Earlier Iron Age, in the fourth and fifth centuries,
the language of Sweden, and consequently also the
people, were Teutonic. These inscriptions in Sweden and
neighboring countries give samples of the earliest known
form of the Northern language, which is considerably
different from its descendants, the Old Swedish, Danish,
Norwegian and Icelandic, but very much resembling the
language spoken by the Goths on the Danube during
the same period.</p>

<p>The Later Iron Age commences with the fifth century
and stretches to the beginning of the eighth century <span class="small">A.D.</span>
When Italy had been overrun by the “barbarians,” the
centre of the old civilization shifted to Byzantium, and
there are many traces of an active intercourse with the
capital of the Byzantine rule in the finds made in Swedish
soil. Most of these finds consist of gold coins of the fifth
century, the majority of them having been found in the
islands of Œland and Gothland. The stream of gold coming
from Byzantium must have been quite considerable,
having its source in the tribute which many of the Byzantine
emperors had to pay to the Goths on the Danube.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
They are the very same emperors whose names appear on
the coins found in Sweden. The great number of costly
and beautiful ornaments of gold found in Sweden, and dating
from this period, must have been made out of Roman
and Byzantine coins, melted down. One of the largest
hoards of gold ever found in Europe was discovered in
the Swedish province of Sœdermanland. Its weight was
twenty-seven pounds, and it contained several ornaments
of consummate workmanship.</p>

<p>Remarkable are the graves from this period, discovered
in the province of Upland. They are barrows containing
the more or less mouldering remains of a large boat in
which the dead man has been buried unburned with his
weapons, horses, and other domestic animals. The swords
found in these graves are of iron with hilts of beautiful
designs in gilded or enamelled bronze. The shields and
helmets are often of elaborate workmanship. Unlike the
swords, which mostly, or perhaps always, are of foreign,
generally of Celtic make, these ornaments and weapons are
of domestic origin.</p>

<p>It appears, from the many beautiful and artistic finds in
Swedish soil, as if the inhabitants have benefited by their
situation, aside and outside of the rest of the world. Continual
migrations subjected the tribes of the continent to
repeated changes and to a never-ceasing series of new and
heterogeneous impressions. The tribes of the North remained
on the same spot, and their whole development
was slower but more consistent. The foreign influences
penetrated slowly and gradually, without crushing the old
civilization. The industrial arts blossomed not so often in
the North as in the South, but steadier, giving a clearer
expression of the national traditions and peculiarities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
These circumstances make the study of Northern antiquities
of absorbing interest.</p>

<p>Before the end of this period, not only Gothaland and
Svealand, but also the coast of Norrland, as far north as
the province of Medelpad, were inhabited. As a whole, the
first part of the Later Iron Age forms a transition between
the Earlier Iron Age and the Viking Age, the archæological
finds of which we must leave aside to take up the threads
of the earliest history. The Viking Age is exceedingly rich
in stones with inscriptions in the later runes, some of these
inscriptions being quite lengthy, and containing strophes
of alliterative verse in Old Swedish.</p>

<p>Before entering into an account of early Swedish history,
let us gather what information the classical writers of history
have to give in regard to the countries of the North, or
rather whatever of such information that has been preserved
to our day.</p>

<p>The Scandinavian countries are for the first time mentioned
by the historians of antiquity in an account of a
journey which Pyteas from Massilia (the present Marseille)
made through Northern Europe, about 300 <span class="small">B.C.</span> He visited
Britain, and there heard of a great country, Thule, situated
six days’ journey to the north, and verging on the
Arctic Sea. The inhabitants in Thule were an agricultural
people who gathered their harvest into big houses for
threshing, on account of the very few sunny days and the
plentiful rain in their regions. From corn and honey they
prepared a beverage (probably the mead). By Thule is
no doubt meant the Scandinavian peninsula, or rather the
western coast of it. Pyteas also tells of the land of amber,
or the southern shores of the Baltic, where the <i>guttones</i> are
dwelling. As the northern and southern shores of the Bal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>tic
from the very earliest period seem to have been inhabited
by the same race which has shared the same development
and civilization, there is every reason to recognize the name
<i>guttones</i> as identical with the one given to the inhabitants
of the Swedish Gothaland and Island of Gothland.</p>

<p>Several centuries pass without any notice of Scandinavia
in the classical literature. In the still preserved manuscripts
of the geographical work by Pomponius Mela, written in the
middle of the first century <span class="small">A.D.</span>, is found a reference to
Codania, a large and fertile island inhabited by Teutons.
Codania is likely some scribe’s misspelling of Scandinavia</p>

<p>Pliny the Elder, who himself visited the shores of the
Baltic in the first century after Christ, is the first to mention
plainly the name of Scandinavia. He says that he
has received advices of immense islands “recently discovered
from Germany.” The most famous of the many
islands situated in the Codanian Bay was Scandinavia, of
as yet unexplored size; the known parts were inhabited by
a people called <i>hilleviones</i>, who gave it the name of another
world. When he speaks of the British isles, Pliny again
gives notice of islands, situated opposite Britain in the
Teutonic Sea, without suspecting their identity with Scandinavia.
He mentions Scandia, Nerigon, the largest of
them all, and Thule. Scandia and Scandinavia are only
different forms of the same name, denoting the southernmost
part of the peninsula, and is yet preserved in the name
of the province of Scania. Nerigon stands for Norway,
the northern part of which is mentioned as an island by
the name Thule. It is not surprising to find the classical
writers ignorant of the fact that Scandinavia was not a
group of large islands, but one great peninsula, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
northern parts were as yet uninhabited and their physical
connection with Finland and Russia unknown.</p>

<p>Tacitus is the first who mentions the Swedish name.
In his work “Germania,” of such great importance for the
knowledge of the ancient Teutons, their conditions and
institutions, and written about 100 years after Christ, the
Baltic is described as an open sea called the Suevian Sea,
shut out from the west by the Danish mainland of Jutland,
by the Romans called the Cimbric Peninsula. The eastern
shore is the country of amber. The Swedes are by Tacitus
called Suiones, and he speaks of them thus:</p>

<p>“Next occur the communities of the Suiones, seated in
the very sea, who, besides their strength in men and arms,
also possess a naval force. The form of their vessels differs
from ours in having a prow at each end, so that they are
always ready to advance. They make no use of sails, nor
have they regular benches of oars at the sides: they row,
as is practiced in some rivers, without order, sometimes
on one side, sometimes on the other, as occasion requires.
These people honor wealth; for which reason they are subject
to monarchial government, without any limitations
or precarious conditions of allegiance. Nor are arms allowed
to be kept promiscuously, as among the other Teutonic
nations: but are committed to the charge of a keeper,
and he, too, a slave. The pretext is that the sea defends
them from any sudden incursions, and men unemployed,
with arms in their hands, readily become licentious. In
fact, it is for the king’s interest not to intrust a noble, a
freeman, or even an emancipated slave, with the custody
of arms.”</p>

<p>These remarks by Tacitus, in all their brevity, are of
great importance. Boats, exactly corresponding to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
description as given, have been found in Swedish graves
of this period, and that they were used for river traffic, to
bring the gold and products of Rome and Byzantium up
the Vistula and Oder, is evident. The great opulence
in dress and temple service of which the archæological
finds bear witness, and of which later writers also speak
as characteristic of the Swedes, is a proof of the wealth
that at all times has attended naval dominion. Thus far
all the statements being fully corroborated, one cannot but
place great importance upon those that follow. The Roman
historian tells us that, on account of the honor which
the Swedes held for wealth, they were subject to a monarchial
government, without any limitations; that is, the
crown was hereditary, not elective. This coincides in every
way with Swedish conditions of political affairs, such as
we know them from later times. The important conclusions
to be gathered from the statements of Tacitus, are
that the Swedes already at the dawn of the Christian era
held the political supremacy in the Scandinavian peninsula,
or at least in its eastern and southern parts, and that the
various lesser communities stood in allegiance to the hereditary
king of the Sviar (Svear), or Swedes in a limited
sense, the inhabitants of Svealand.</p>

<p>The psychological conclusions made by Tacitus, on the
basis of his own statements, hold good of the Swedes of
to-day as well as of those of 2,000 years ago. They still
honor wealth and a monarchial government and consider
the sea their best defence against foreign foes.</p>

<p>Ptolemy, the Alexandrine geographer of the second
century after Christ, speaks of the Scandinavian islands,
situated east of the Cimbrian peninsula. The fourth and
most easterly of these is the one originally called Scandeia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
He enumerates six tribes which inhabit it, the names being
unrecognizable, except the one of Gutai, Gauts or Goths,
by him for the first time mentioned as dwelling in Scandinavia.</p>

<p>To this information, gathered from classical authors,
nothing is added for the next four hundred years in regard
to the countries of the North. Only in the sixth century,
when Rome has succumbed before the Gothic invasions,
and the Teutonic tribes have divided between themselves
the provinces of the West Roman empire, new information
about Sweden is given by a Byzantine author, Prokopios,
a contemporary of emperor Justinian. He mentions Scandinavia
by the name Thule, and says he bases his statements
upon information obtained from people “who come
from there.”</p>

<p>Prokopios says that in the immense island of Thule,
in the northern part of which the midnight sun can be
seen, thirteen large tribes occupy its inhabitable parts,
each tribe having its own king. One of the largest tribes
is the Gauts (the Gœtar, or the inhabitants of Swedish
Gothaland). These tribes very much resemble the people
of southern Europe, with the exception of the Skee Finns,
who dress in skins and live from the chase.</p>

<p>Prokopios tells a remarkable story about an immigration
to Sweden of Herulians, a Teutonic tribe closely connected
to the Goths on the Danube. In the beginning
of the sixth century, it happened that the Herulians, after
an unsuccessful war with the Longobardians, were divided
into two branches, of which the one received land from the
emperor Anastasius south of the Danube, while the other
made a resolve to seek a home in the Scandinavian peninsula.
When they had passed the Slavs, they came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
uninhabited regions, whence they continued to the country
of the Varinians, and later to that of the Danes. The
Danes granted them a free passage and the use of ships,
in which they crossed to the island of Thule. Here the
Herulians went to the Gauts and were well received by
them. Some decades later the Herulians in South Europe
were in want of a king. They resolved to send messengers
to their kinsmen who had settled in Sweden, hoping that
some descendant of their old royal family might be found
there who was willing to assume the dignity of king among
them. The messengers returned with two brothers who
belonged to the ancient family of rulers, and these were
escorted by two hundred young Herulians from Sweden.
That this immigration really took place there is no doubt.
The district of Sweden where these kinsmen of the Goths
settled was early distinguished from the surrounding ones,
inhabited by the Gauts of Sweden, through the peculiarities
of its laws and customs, of which some survived into
the commencement of the nineteenth century. This district
forms the southern part of the province of Smaland, called
Værend, its inhabitants Virdar, and the adjoining province
of Bleking.</p>

<p>The Gothic historian Jordanes, or Jornandes, called
Master Ardan, who was a contemporary of Prokopios, has
taken upon himself to explain the reason of the strange
resolve of the Herulians to seek a home in Sweden. He
speaks of the traditions of the East Goths, which tell of their
descent from the people of the North. Similar traditions
also have existed among the West Goths, Longobardians,
Gepidæ, Burgundians, Herulians, Franks, Saxons, Swabians
and Alemannians. Thus Jordanes: “In the North
there is a great ocean, and in this ocean there is a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
island called Scandza, out of whose loins our race burst
forth like a swarm of bees and spread over Europe.” The
island of Scandza, he says, has been <i>officina gentium</i>,
<i>vagina nationum</i>&mdash;the source of races, the mother of nations.
And thence also the Goths have emigrated.</p>

<p>Material is lacking to prove the historical truth of the
Teutonic traditions which point to Scandinavia as the cradle
of the Teutonic tribes. But Jordanes, the first historian of
Teutonic birth who speaks of Scandinavia, stands at the
cradle of Swedish history, and, as a modern historian has
expressed it, his shadow throws an umbrage across the
whole field of Swedish historical research. The mistake,
based upon Jordanes’ history, of identifying the Swedish
Gauts with the Goths has caused a great deal of mischief
and ridiculous chauvinism, Gothic and Swedish history and
royal lines being mixed up or put in connection with each
other.</p>

<p>In leaving aside the Teutonic traditions of the island
of Scandza, or Scania, as the cradle of the race, let us
quote a remark by Tacitus which seems to point to the
conclusion that such traditions were current already in
the first century of the Christian era: “I should think
that the Teutons themselves are aborigines, and not at
all mixed through immigrations or connections with non-Teutonic
tribes. For those desiring to change homes did
not in early times come by land, but in ships across the
boundless and, so to speak, hostile ocean&mdash;a sea seldom
visited by ships from the Roman world.”</p>

<p>The Old English poem of Beowulf must also be mentioned
among the sources which throw light on early Swedish
history. Whether the Geátas of Beowulf are identical
with the Jutes of Denmark, or with the Gauts of Sweden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
is a much disputed question. Although, phonetically, the
Old English name Geátas corresponds to the Old Swedish
<i>Gautar</i>, it seems most plausible to suppose that by this
term is meant the Jutes, and not the inhabitants of Swedish
West or East Gothland. This accepted, the poem does
not contain much about the Swedes. But the information,
therein given, of the Swedish kings is of great value, because
it renders the service of a firm chronological support
to the facts gathered from another source. This source,
of vastly greater importance, is the Ynglinga Saga, or rather
the poem around which it is spun, in Heimskringla,
of which more in the next chapter.</p>

<p>The first information of the religion practiced by the
inhabitants of Scandinavia is given by Prokopios, who says
that they worshipped many gods and spirits of the sky,
air, earth, sea, and also some who were supposed to dwell
in springs and rivers. Offerings were constantly made,
the chief ones being of human beings, for which the first
prisoner made in a war was destined. This sacrifice was
made to “Mars,” who was the highest god. The statements
of Prokopios without doubt are correct. The Scandinavian
war-god who corresponds to the Mars of classical
mythology was Tyr. Odin, originally the ruler of the
wind, became the highest god during the Viking Age.
He is an aristocratic god, the god of the select few, whose
cult succeeded that of Tyr as the cult of the latter had
succeeded that of Thor, the thunderer, as the highest god.
The idea of a supreme God was probably unknown until
the contact with Christianity, or at least not common.
Thor, the peasant god, is probably the oldest of the gods
of Teutonic mythology, the representative of stern power
and law-bound order. Thor was the most popular god<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
of the Swedes, to judge from the great number of ancient
Swedish proper names of which his forms a part. Besides
Thor, Odin and Frey were the most honored. All the
other gods and goddesses mentioned in Old Norse literature
were probably known, but few of them much worshipped
in Sweden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Dawn of Swedish History&mdash;Heimskringla and
Ynglingatal</i></span></h2>

<p>Snorre Sturleson, the great historian and poet
of Iceland, of the earlier half of the thirteenth century,
is considered to be the author of the history of
the kings of Norway which, after the first words of the
first chapter, has been called Heimskringla. As an introduction
to the work he has put the saga of the Yngling
kings of Sweden, of whom many of the Norwegian kings
were supposed to be descendants. The Ynglinga Saga is
a paraphrase to the much older song of Ynglingatal, a
poem composed by the Norwegian poet Thiodulf of Hvin
(who lived in the latter part of the ninth century) in praise
of the supposed Swedish ancestors of the Norwegian king
Ragnvald. The Ynglings were probably not identical with
the kings of Upsala, who were of the race of the Skilfings,
but of South Swedish or Danish origin. It is either out
of ignorance, or out of sagacity, that the poet selected the
Upsala rulers as originators of the Norwegian line of kings,
but he has been unfortunate in the choice of a name for
the dynasty. The poem itself is a trustworthy historical
document, at least as far as the times are concerned which
come comparatively close to the time of its own composition,
the first part containing many traits of a mythical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
character. The saga spun around it is far from trustworthy.
Of the poem evidently the first, or first few,
strophes are missing, but the “historian” supplies the vacuum
with stories of the gods Odin, Niord and Frey, whom
he, according to the ideas of his time, changes from gods
into historic kings, the first who ruled Svithiod (Sweden).
Among learned men in Snorre’s day there was a craze for
tracing the pedigree of all nations of any renown back to
some of the heroes of ancient Troy. Snorre serves us a
saga of Odin’s migration from Troy which, besides being
confuse, would appear only ridiculous, if it had not wielded
about as highly disastrous an influence upon correct conceptions
of Swedish history as the work by Jordanes. This
migration saga is found in a still more elaborate form in
an introduction to Snorre’s Edda, and is responsible for
the erroneous opinion held by earlier Swedish historians,
that the Swedes had migrated from Asia under the leadership
of a chief who called himself Odin, and that the
Swedes and the Gauts were, if not of different origin, at
least of a habitation of differing age in their present locations.</p>

<p>Based upon the information found in Ynglinga Saga
we will give a review of the history of the early kings of
Sweden, although the first dozen, and more, of these kings
are of a doubtful “historic” character. At the dawn of
history, Sweden was, like most other countries of Northern
Europe, divided into petty communities, each ruled
by a king. These communities seem to have been nearly
identical with the “lands” or later provinces into which
Sweden is yet divided, although the administrative divisions
are different. In spite of the fact that it is about 1,200
years since these communities were united into one single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
realm, the inhabitants preserve to this day their respective
peculiarities of customs and language.</p>

<p>The most important among the chieftains of Sweden
was, since time immemorial, the king of Upsala, who conducted
the sacrifices and temple service at Upsala, the
oldest and most celebrated place of heathen worship in
the Scandinavian North. Originally, he had under his
rule only one-third of the present province of Upland, the
chief settlement of the Sviar, or Swedes in a limited sense.
The Upsala kings belonged to the ancient royal race of
Skilfings (or “Ynglings,” according to Snorre), who traced
their origin from the gods. The founder of the dynasty
as accepted by Thiodulf and others was <i>Yngve</i>, who is
said to have built the great temple at Upsala, moving
thither the capital from the older Sigtuna and contributing
to the temple all his lands and riches. Yngve’s son
was <i>Fiolner</i>. King Fiolner was drowned by accident in
a huge vessel full of mead, during a visit paid to King
Frode in Denmark.</p>

<p>His son <i>Sveigder</i> disappeared during a journey which
he made in order to find Odin, the old. Both the names
Fiolner and Sveigder appear to be mythical. Sveigder’s
son <i>Vanlande</i> was a great warrior. He is said once to
have taken up his winter abode in Finland, which, together
with several archæological finds, point to an early intercourse
between Sweden and Finland. <i>Visbur</i> succeeded
his father Vanlande, marrying the daughter of Aude (the
Rich), whom he afterward left and took another wife,
bringing on himself a curse by so doing. Visbur’s sons
fell unexpectedly over him, burning him in his house.
<i>Domalde</i>, his son, succeeded him. During a great famine
in Svithiod he was offered to the gods in order to obtain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
good seasons. Domalde’s son and grandson, <i>Domar</i> and
<i>Dygve</i>, both reigned and died in peace. <i>Dag</i>, the son of
Dygve, was so wise a man that he understood the language
of birds. <i>Agne</i>, the son of Dag, was the ruler after him.
One summer he invaded Finland with his army. When
the Finns gathered there was a great battle, in which
Agne gained victory, subduing all Finland. The daughter
of a conquered chief, Skialf, was carried back to Sweden
as his bride. But after a drinking feast, Agne was hanged
in a tree by Skialf and her men. The place where this
happened was called Agnefit, and is said to be identical
with the site of Stockholm, the later capital of the country.
<i>Alrek</i> and <i>Eric</i> became kings after the death of their
father Agne. They got into a dispute one day while out
walking. Having no weapons, they assailed and killed
each other with their horses’ bridles. Their successors,
<i>Yngve</i> and <i>Alf</i>, the sons of Alrek, shared a similar fate,
killing each other in the royal hall by the high-seat. After
them <i>Hugleik</i>, the son of Alf, became king of the Swedes.
On the Fyrisvols, the plains by the river Fyris in Upland,
Hugleik was killed in battle against a famous sea-king
Hake, who subdued the country and became king of
Svithiod. The saga mentions that this Hake was a
brother of Hagbard, whose love for the king’s daughter,
Signe, cost him his life. This love story is one of the
most famous in the North and much spoken of in saga
and song. The spot where Hagbard was hanged in a tree
is still pointed out. When Hake had ruled as king for
three years, <i>Jorund</i> and <i>Eric</i>, the sons of Yngve, returned
with warships and warriors. They had grown up and
become famous by conquering the king Gudlaug, of the
Haleygians in Norway, whom they had met in Denmark.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Now they met King Hake and his army at the Fyrisvols.
In the battle, Eric was killed and Jorund fled to his ship.
But King Hake was himself so grievously wounded that
he ordered a warship to be loaded with his dead men and
their weapons, and himself to be placed upon it. The sails
were hoisted and the ship set on fire, and out it flew, with
the dying king on board, between the skerries to the sea.
Jorund now became king in Upsala. When he was one
summer marauding in Jutland, he met a son of King Gudlaug,
in the battle with whom he was overpowered, captured
and hanged.</p>

<p>King <i>Aune</i> or <i>Ane</i> was the son of Jorund. He was a
wise man who made great sacrifices to the gods. Being
no warrior he lived quietly at home. Twice he fled from
Upsala, on account of Danish invasions, remaining in West
Gothland twenty-five years each time, and holding sway
at Upsala for an equally long time between his periods of
exile. He lived to become 110 years of age. The secret
of his longevity was that he sacrificed one of his sons to
Odin every tenth year, and was granted in return a decade
of prolonged life. When about to sacrifice his tenth son,
the people interfered, and he died from old age. The last
ten years of his life he was very feeble, drinking out of a
horn like an infant. He was buried in a mound at Upsala.</p>

<p>King <i>Egil</i> was the son of Ane, and, like his father, no
warrior. Under his reign and that of his son, king <i>Ottar</i>,
Sweden suffered a good deal of trouble from Denmark.
The Danish king Frode had helped Egil against the revolt
of one of his subjects, and demanded from his son a
scat, or tribute, in return. Ottar fell in battle against the
jarls of Frode. Both he and his son <i>Audils</i>, who ruled
Svithiod after him, are mentioned in Beowulf as Ôhthere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
and his son Eadgils of the royal Swedish line of the Scylfingas
(Skilfings). This fact gives to Swedish history its
first reliable date. The Danish king Hugleik, a contemporary
of King Ottar, died in 515 <span class="small">A.D.</span>, which renders with
a certainty Ottar’s reign as falling in the first part of the
sixth century. Audils ruled for a long time and often went
on viking expeditions to Saxonland, Denmark and Norway.
In Saxonland, Audils captured the household of King Geirthiof,
among whom was a remarkably beautiful girl, called
Yrsa. The king married her, but she was afterward taken
to Denmark by King Helge of Leire after a successful plundering
expedition in Svithiod. Helge had a son by her,
Rolf Krake, but Yrsa returned to her first husband, after
being told by Queen Alof, the wife of Geirthiof, that Helge
was her father and Alof her mother. When Rolf Krake
later became king his men once helped King Audils in one
of his expeditions in Norway. King Rolf’s men did not
receive the compensation promised them, and Rolf came
to Upsala to demand it for them. King Rolf was warned
by his mother Yrsa that Audils was not well disposed, and
he and his men made in haste for their ships. King Audils
and his men started out in their pursuit. Then Rolf took a
horn filled with gold, a recent gift of his mother, emptying
its contents on the plain. Audils and his men stopped to
pick up the gold, and Rolf thus made his escape. Rolf
Krake is one of the most famous of Danish heroes. In the
poetic language of the Old Northern literature, gold is often
called “the seed of the Fyrisvols” or “Rolf Krake’s seed.”
As King Audils once rode around the hall at a sacrifice his
horse stumbled and fell, and the king was killed.</p>

<p><i>Eystein</i>, the son of Audils, ruled after him and was
succeeded by his son <i>Yngvar</i>. Eystein was never able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
defend his people against the Danes, while Yngvar was a
successful warrior, both at home and abroad. But one
summer when he was fighting in Esthonia he was killed
by the Esthonians. He was buried in a mound close to
the seashore.</p>

<p><i>Anund</i> was Yngvar’s son and successor. He went to
Esthonia to avenge his father, ravaging the country and
returning with great booty. In his time there were fruitful
seasons in Svithiod. On this account, and because he made
many roads, cleared the woods and cultivated the new land,
he became one of the most popular of early Swedish kings.
He was called <i>Brœt-Anund</i>, viz., Anund Roadmaker.</p>

<p><i>Ingiald</i>, the son of Anund, became king in Upsala after
his father. He was the most remarkable of all the Ynglings
(Skilfings), for, through violence and cunning, he
united all the communities of Sweden into one realm.
When his father died, the king at Upsala was certainly
the supremely powerful ruler in Svithiod, but not the only
one, for there were many district-kings who were to a great
extent independent. There were not only kings in East
Gothland, Sœdermanland, and Nerike, but in Upland there
were, besides the Upsala king, also kings in each of the
three “lands” into which this province was formerly
divided; viz., Tiundaland, Attundaland, and Fiedrundaland.
Ingiald ordered a great feast to celebrate the fact
that he had come to the throne after his father, and invited
seven other kings, all of whom were present, except Granmar,
king of Sœdermanland. When the Brage-bowl, on
which promises were made, was carried in, King Ingiald
made a solemn vow to enlarge his dominions by one-half,
toward all the four corners of the world, or die. In the
evening Ingiald set fire to the hall, and all the six royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
guests perished with their followers. Ingiald took possession
of all the dominions belonging to the unfortunate
kings. In the next year he surrounded the hall in
which King Granmar found himself at the time, killing
him and taking his land in possession. “It was a common
saying,” Snorre tells us, “that King Ingiald had killed
twelve kings and deceived them all under pretence of peace;
therefore he was called Ingiald Illrade (the evil-adviser).”
His daughter, Asa, was of the same disposition as her
father. She was married to Gudrod, king of Scania, but
had to flee from the land after having caused the death of
her husband and his brother. When it was learned that
King Ivar, nephew of Gudrod, had entered Svithiod with
an army, Asa counselled her father to set fire to the hall
of the king after his men were drunk and asleep. Thus
perished Ingiald Illrade with his daughter, very much in
the same fashion in which he had killed so many of the
petty kings.</p>

<p>For the centuries following upon Ingiald’s death, Snorre
has a very short, or almost no account to give about Sweden
and her rulers. What can be gathered from other sources,
principally from late Icelandic sagas, is not trustworthy,
mythical and fictitious elements being discernible.</p>

<p>After Ingiald, <i>Ivar Vidfamne</i> (the Far-stretching) is
said to have ruled Sweden, “also Denmark, Saxonland, all
of Austria and one-fifth of England.” One account has
it that Ivar was the head of a new dynasty in Sweden.
As he was originally king of Scania, perhaps these were
the real Ynglings. Another source claims for the succeeding
Swedish kings descent from the old race of the
Ynglings (viz., the Skilfings). Ingiald’s son Olof, according
to Snorre, fled to the woods of Vermland, until then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
uninhabited, and later came to Norway. But it is a misunderstanding
of Thiodulf’s lines which causes Snorre to
say that King Olof was buried close by the Lake Venar,
in Vermland. The province of Vermland was inhabited
much earlier than in Olof’s time, and the Olof who became
the founder of a Norwegian dynasty was probably
a Danish prince.</p>

<p><i>Harald Hildetand</i> of Denmark is said to have succeeded
Ivar, and to have ruled over as much territory as his mother’s
father. Several sources speak of King Harald and the
battle of Bravols, in which his life was ended and which
battle generally is taken as a historic milestone, marking
the opening of the Viking Age. It was fought somewhere
about the year 740. King Harald had become old and
almost blind. In Svithiod and West Gothland, the kings
Sigurd and Ring (by the sagas made into one hero by the
name “Sigurd Ring”) ruled under Harald, while he reigned
himself over Denmark and East Gothland. The relations
were good at first, but their aspect soon changed. After
great preparations on either side, Ring met Harald on the
plains of Bravik in East Gothland. The battle was a long
and bloody one and the most renowned in song and saga.
King Harald, too old to take an active part, mounted a
chariot, which carried him into the midst of the fight.
When King Ring at last saw the chariot empty, he understood
that the aged king had fallen and gave the sign that
the battle should come to an end. King Ring caused the
remains of his fallen foe to be burned with great pomp and
ceremony on a pile with his horse, weapons and many a
costly treasure of gold and silver. King <i>Ring</i> was said to
have been ruler of Sweden and Denmark after King Harald.
The sagas mention the hero, <i>Ragnar Lodbrok</i>, as his son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
and successor. While this great viking and sea-king appears
to have been a historic personage in the earlier half
of the ninth century, it is impossible that he could have
been identical with King Ring’s son <i>Ragnar</i>, or that he
or his sons ever were kings in Upsala or Sweden.</p>

<p>With the first attempts to introduce Christianity into
Sweden (of which more later) a more definite knowledge
of Swedish rulers and conditions is gained. When Ansgar,
the apostle of Sweden, visited the country for the first time,
about 830, the ruling king was <i>Biœrn</i>. Shortly afterward
King <i>Anund</i> is mentioned. He fled from his land, but was
reinstated with the help of the Danes. King <i>Olof</i> was on the
throne at the time of Ansgar’s second visit to Sweden, about
850. These kings must have been of the same family as
those who held the throne up to the middle of the eleventh
century, for their names all occur again in the line of later
Swedish kings, the reigns of whom fall in the broad light
of history.</p>

<p>We have seen how Ingiald Illrade joined the various
communities into one single realm. Although there is doubt
whether this realm from the start embraced all Sweden,
there is no historical evidence or any reliable traditions
whatever to show that Sweden was ever divided into
smaller kingdoms after the death of King Ingiald. When
Ansgar reaches Sweden he travels through half of the country
in order to reach the commercial centre of Birka, where
the king of Sweden is dwelling. No other king, great
or petty, is spoken of, while the contemporary Icelanders
mention jarls (earls) in Gothaland, which proves that the
once independent kings in that district were made away
with.</p>

<p>Of particular importance is the account of a journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
which a certain Wulfstan made to the North, at the close
of the ninth century. This account is given in an Old English
translation of Orosii Historia, credited to King Alfred
of England. Thus it runs: “Wulfstan said that he went
from Schleswig to Truso in seven days, that the ship was all
the way running under sail. Wendland was on his right,
but Langeland, Lolland, Falster and Scania on his left, and
all these lands belong to Denmark, and then Bornholm was
on our left, which has a king of its own. Then after Bornholm,
the lands of Bleking, Mœre, Œland, and Gotland,
were first on our left, and these lands belong to Sweden.”</p>

<p>Wulfstan’s account, besides furnishing evidence to prove
the political consolidation of Sweden, also gives a good idea
of the size of the country in this period. The once independent
province of Scania, which had kings of its own,
already belongs to Denmark. So does also the province
of Halland, while Bohuslæn belongs to Norway. Dal and
Vermland are contested provinces between the kings of
Sweden and Norway, while great parts of Norrland are
yet uninhabited, except by Laps, who ramble from one
place to another, without a fixed dwelling place. In King
Alfred’s Orosius, Danish Jutland and Swedish Gautland
(Gothaland) are alike called <i>Gotland</i>, which recalls the
supposition of the majority of modern scholars that Gotland
was in the earliest times the common Teutonic name of
the North, and Goths the common name of its Teutonic
inhabitants.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>The Viking Age&mdash;Ansgar, the Apostle of Sweden</i></span></h2>

<p>“In the North there is a great ocean, and in this ocean
there is a large island called Scandza, out of whose
loins our race burst forth like a swarm of bees and
spread over Europe.” These were the words the Gothic
historian Jordanes put on parchment, inspired by the popular
traditions of a Teutonic migration from the North.
Historic evidence is lacking to prove or disprove the truth
of these words. But they may be applied to the phenomenon
which has given its name to the <i>Viking Age</i>.</p>

<p>The Viking expeditions seem to stand in connection with
the great Teutonic migrations, at least to be related to
them in nature. The Teutons of the North were not directly
affected by the migrations, but at the close of the
eighth century the same restlessness and desire of expansion
appear to have taken possession of the Northmen as
in earlier times of their relatives in more southerly lands.
And it was a timely move, for the energy and strength
with which these had in their time suffused Europe were
dying out. Europe was in need of new blood and iron to
wake her from her anæmia and to build up new institutions.
The North was freed from a turbulent and lawless
element and was brought in closer contact than ever before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
with the learning and culture of the world. For centuries
the Northmen had through their southern kinsmen been
in contact with continental culture. But now they came
out to see for themselves, to make themselves a place in
a wider and richer world, or to bring home from there
what they most desired of beauty, riches and culture.
They were not delicate as to means. Violence was with
them as natural as their freedom of individuality was indispensable.
Yet they were to play a most important part
in the cultural development of Europe, furnishing her with
institutions of imperishable iron and changing the darkness
of the Middle Ages into an era of chivalry in spirit
and in deeds.</p>

<p>The Viking expeditions were always undertaken by free
men, and were in the North, from remotest times, considered
not only an honest but an honorable occupation. Slaves
and freed men were excluded. The leaders&mdash;often kings
or their sons&mdash;were always men of noble descent or of
importance. As the Viking expeditions took on larger
proportions, they became more and more organized; from
random expeditions, undertaken by individuals, they developed
into national undertakings, led by the king or his
chieftains, not for a pastime, but in completion of a national
policy. On account of this latest aspect, it is but just to
divide the field in which the Northmen were active according
to their respective nationalities. With such a division
applied, the Viking expeditions to the West, to Britain,
France, Portugal and Spain do not pertain to Swedish
history, for they were planned and undertaken principally
by Danes and Norwegians. It is true that there were many
Swedish participants also in these expeditions, as the sagas
and the memorial stones on Swedish soil tell us; also true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
that some of the later Swedish provinces, like Bohuslæn<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
and Scania, sent out their large contingents of Vikings and
sea-kings to the West, and that one of the oldest Swedish
homes of culture, West Gothland, had an appropriate
channel to the West, by way of the mighty Gotha River,
through which without doubt many a Viking expedition
was sent; yet the leaders were in a majority of cases Danish
or Norwegian chieftains. For similar reasons the Viking
expeditions to the East belong by right to Swedish
history. In them the participants and chieftains were
Swedes, to an overwhelming majority, and, from time
immemorial, Swedish districts from which the expeditions
were started.</p>

<p>To Russia the Swedes first went on marauding expeditions;
but after the countries of the North had been shaped
into three large monarchies, they came to Russia upon
special invitation, in order to found there a realm of strong
and consistent government. This becomes evident from
the testimony of the Russian historian Nestor, a monk in
Kief, who lived in the latter part of the eleventh century.
About the founding of the Russian empire by the Swedes
he has the following remarkable statements:</p>

<p>“In the year 6367 (after the creation of the world, which
is the 859th after the birth of Christ) the Variagi (or Varangians)
came across the sea, taking tribute from the Tchud
and the Slavs,” etc.&mdash;“In the year 6370 (862 <span class="small">A.D.</span>) they
chased the Variagi back across the sea, giving them no
tribute and commencing to govern themselves, but it turned
out badly with legal affairs, tribe rose against tribe, caus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>ing
strife, and a rebellion was started. Then they said
between themselves: ‘Let us seek a prince who will govern
us and reason with us justly!’ And they went across
the sea to the Variagi, to the Russians, for thus were the
Variagi called, just as others were called Sviar, others Nurmanni,
others Anglii, and others Goths. And the Tchudi
(the Slavs of Novgorod), the Slavs, the Krivitchi and the
Vessi said to the Russians, ‘Our land is great and fruitful,
but it lacks order and justice; come and take possession,
and govern us!’ And three brothers with their followers
were selected, and they took the whole of Rus with them
and came. And the oldest, Rurik, took his abode in Novgorod,
the second, Sineus, his in Bielo-Jesero, and the third,
his in Isborsk; his name was Truvor. After two years
Sineus and his brother Truvor died. Rurik then took the
whole power into his hands and gave towns over to his
men, giving to one Polotsk, to another Rostof, and to a
third Bielo-Jesero. And into these towns the Variagi have
migrated; the earlier inhabitants in Novgorod were Slavs,
in Polotsk, Krivitchi, in Rostof, Meri, and in Bielo-Jesero,
Vessi.”</p>

<p>That the Variagi were of Swedish descent, and that it
was they who gave the name of Russia to the Slav countries,
is proved beyond the possibility of a doubt. A most
weighty argument is the large number of Swedish names
in the list of Variag princes who reigned in Russia. It
would not have been possible for Nestor to devise the more
than one hundred leading names of Swedish origin which
occur in his chronicle. Furthermore, it has been shown that
there are fifteen Swedish loanwords in Russian. This is
very much. Great and powerful nations have left behind
a good deal less in modern languages, the Vandals three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
words, the Burgundians four or five, the Herulians one.
Although the Swedes in Russia had no literature in their
ancestral language, they have left behind more words than
the majority of Teutonic tribes founding states and nations.
The Old Swedish equivalents to some of the
most important proper names which meet us in early Russian
history are as follows: Rurik&mdash;Hrœrekr, Sineus&mdash;Signjótr,
Truvor&mdash;Tryggve, Oleg&mdash;Helge, Olga&mdash;Helga, Igor&mdash;Inge,
Ingvar.</p>

<p>For two hundred years after Rurik, all the leading men
in Russian history carry Swedish names, and all the czars
of Russia were the descendants of Rurik, up to the year
1598. The emperor and historian Constantine Porphyrogenitus,
speaking of Russia, makes the distinction between
the Slavs and the Russians proper. In his description of
the cataracts of the Dniepr, he gives to each the Russian
and the Slav name, and these Russian names are nearly
all understood by reference to old Swedish roots. Examples
are Gellandri (Gellandi)&mdash;the Noisy, Eyfórr&mdash;the Always
Turbulent. Luitprand, the Italian chronicler, speaking
of the Russians, says: “The Greeks call them Russians,
we call them properly Northmen.” The annals of St.
Bertinus tell how Emperor Theophilus recommended some
Russian envoys to Louis le Débonnaire, but how he, taking
them for Norman spies, threw them into prison. The first
Russian Code of Laws, compiled by Iaroslaf, presents a
striking analogy to the Old Swedish laws.</p>

<p>The Slavs must have originally borrowed the name Russian
from the Finns, who, up to the present day, call the
Swedes <i>Ruotsi</i>. The name is in Sweden connected with
a part of the coast of Upland still called Roslagen. The
etymology of the name is Old Swedish <i>rodr</i> (rudder)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
and <i>roðsmenn</i> (oarsmen). Roslagen means “associations
of oarsmen.” The district is famous for its large peculiar
rowboats. By the term Russians, the Slavs originally
meant people from Roslagen, later Sweden in general. But
when these Russians had become the founders of a new
empire, south of the Baltic, it became necessary to devise
a new name for the inhabitants of Sweden. This name
was found in Variagi. Only the Swedes seeking employment
as sworn warriors in the service of the new Russian
dynasty, or in the body-guard of the Byzantine emperors,
were originally thus called. But when the name of the
new nation of Swedes and Slavs became Russians, the
Swedes, and the Scandinavians in general, became known
as Variagi. The etymology of the word has been given as
the Old Swedish <i>vár</i> (<i>sacramentum</i>) and <i>væringar</i> (<i>sacramentarii</i>,
soldiers bound by oath). The same name applied
to Swedes, or Northmen, occurs frequently in slightly
altered forms in Greek and Arabic manuscripts.</p>

<p>While Rurik and his brothers were building towns,
which probably means the fortifying of ancient villages,
two other Variagi, Askold and Dir, who were not of the
family of Rurik, went down to Kief, and reigned over the
Poliané. It was they who began the expeditions against
Byzantium in 865. In speaking of this, Nestor calls the
Bosphorus <i>Sud</i>, an Old Swedish word meaning a sound.
The Bosphorus is also called Sud on a Swedish memorial
stone over a man who was killed in a similar expedition.</p>

<p>Oleg, the fourth brother of Rurik, was his successor,
his son Igor being yet a minor. He was an energetic man
and a great administrator.</p>

<p>Smolensk, Lubetch and Kief were captured, and Askold
and Dir put to death. Between the years 879-912, Oleg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
organized the Russian empire. For the sake of commerce,
he tried to preserve peace with the Greeks, but when difficulties
arose he called in new armies from Sweden and
great expeditions started against Byzantium. But these
Variagi were an unruly element, and, in order to satisfy
their desire for war and booty, the Russian rulers always
let a plundering expedition to the Caspian Sea follow every
unsuccessful attack upon Byzantium; also when war with
the Greeks was avoided through decrees of peace, expeditions
to the Caspian Sea took place.</p>

<p>These expeditions against the Arabs, who inhabited the
coasts of the Caspian Sea, were neither in any marked
degree successful. Masudi is the first author among the
Arabs who mentions the expeditions of the Swedes. They
came down the river Volga in their ships. The Arabs
describe the “Rûs” as blond and “tall as palm-trees.”
The burial of a Rûs is described by Ibn Fosslan, who visited
Bulgaria in 921. “The hero was burned in a ship
with weapons, horses, dogs and a woman.” In 965, the
Israelite, Ibrahim Ibn Jakub, made a journey to Germany.
He tells that the Arabs in his day with Rûs (Russians)
meant partly the Swedes of Sweden, “who often came in
ships from the West to plunder,” partly the Swedes settled
in Russia, “who speak the language of the Slavs, on account
of admixture with them.”</p>

<p>It was the destiny of the Swedes in Russia to exchange
their language for that of the Slavs and finally to absorb
Slav customs. Such might not have been the case if they
had been greater in numbers, or if their coming had been
deferred to a later, Christian period, when to a strong form
of government would have been added a strong Church
organization. Yet their influence was greater than that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
of the Vikings in any other country, for the Russian empire
was entirely a Northern creation.</p>

<p>To follow further the Rurik dynasty would lead us away
from Swedish into Russian history. But let us mention
that Oleg was succeeded by Rurik’s son Igor, who also
was a great war-lord, and undertook the third expedition
of Russians and Variagi against Byzantium. His widow
was the celebrated Olga, who was converted to Christianity
and afterward canonized. She reigned during the minority
of her son Sviatoslaf, whose conversion she was never able
to effect. Sviatoslaf’s son and grandson, Saint Vladimir
and Jaroslaf the Great, were the Clovis and the Charlemagne
of Russia.</p>

<p>After the conquest of Kief, Oleg commanded a tribute
to be paid to the Variagi “for the preservation of peace.”
This tribute to the Swedes was paid up to the death of
Jaroslaf, who in 1019 gave assurance to the king of Upsala
that it should be paid regularly, Vladimir having neglected
to do so. This tribute could be nothing else than a scat
paid to the king of Sweden by the rulers of Russia during
the ninth and tenth centuries. Sweden possessed in those
days a large territory south of the Baltic, which paid scat
to the king of Upsala. It was called Austria (<i>Austerike</i>),
and reference to it under this name is often made in sagas,
chronicles and inscriptions. Ynglinga Saga gives incidents
of close Swedish connections to Finland and the Baltic provinces,
and archæological finds point to Swedish settlements
in Finland, already in the prehistoric period. Memories of
conquests are preserved in statements by the Icelanders
and by Saxo, the Danish historian, about the Austria of
which the Swedish kings Ivar Vidfamne, Harald Hildetand,
“Sigurd” Ring and Ragnar “Lodbrok” were rulers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Closest to an exact statement comes Snorre, who says that
King Eric Edmundson of Sweden ruled over Finland, Carelia,
Esthonia, Courland and “wide over all Austria.”
These countries belonged to Sweden until King Olof Skœtkonung
“let all his scatlands get away from him.” The
chronicler Rimbert says that Courland, by which he means
the Baltic provinces, in 850 belonged to Sweden. Shortly
after this date fall, according to Nestor, those of the first
Swedish contact with interior Russia (859) and of the founding
of the Russian empire by Rurik (862). The Swedish
dominion in the Baltic provinces, as well as the early Russian
empire, must consequently have held a position similar
to the one of Normandie to France and England.</p>

<p>The old Swedish name for Russia was Gardarike, for
Novgorod Holmgard and for Byzantium Miklagard, which
mean “Country of towns,” “Island town,” and “Great
town,” respectively.</p>

<p>Vladimir of Russia, in 980, sent a number of Variagi
to the emperor. But already the emperors had probably
surrounded themselves with a small standing army
of Variagi or Barangoi, as they were called by the Greeks.
They were treated with a good deal of respect and consideration,
and in the North it was considered a distinction to
have served in Miklagard, which even the sons of kings
eagerly sought for. Soon not only Swedes, but also Norwegians,
Danes and Icelanders were attracted, and Icelandic
sources have a good many, in part wildly exaggerated,
accounts of the Variagi and their experiences in
Miklagard. The Northmen were relied upon to support the
tottering empire, and were despatched to the points where
the hardest combats were fought. They had officers of their
own nationality, and the strictest discipline was maintained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
About the year 1050 a detachment of Variagi were accepted
into the body-guard of the emperor, surrounding his person
on all great occasions and in public; also keeping watch over
the imperial palace. When the emperor died, they had,
according to Snorre, the privilege of passing through his
treasury, each taking along all he could carry off. Another
privilege of theirs was that they were allowed to keep their
heathen faith in the midst of the Christian surroundings.</p>

<p>Many and various as the reasons for the Viking expeditions
must have been, the principal cause that led to their
abolition was the contact with Christianity abroad, and the
introduction of its teaching in the heathen North. The first
missionaries to Sweden were sent by Louis the Pious, but
Christianity was not entirely unknown before their arrival.
For centuries, the Swedes had through commercial expeditions
stood in direct or indirect contact with the Christian
world, and this had brought home some knowledge of “the
white Christ” and his gospel of peace. Many Northmen
had been baptized while dwelling in foreign lands, and
many must the Christian thralls have been who continually
were brought into the country. The influence these
elements exerted probably could be traced to the ennobling
and developing of heathen myths, rather than to direct
Christian conversions. And a similar influence of Roman
and Greek myths, without doubt, exerted upon the North
in earlier historic times.</p>

<p>Ansgar, a learned and pious monk from the convent of
Corvey, became the apostle of Sweden. He had spent two
years in Denmark as a missionary when called upon by
Emperor Louis to visit Sweden. Louis the Pious had received
the assurance by Swedish emissaries that the new
faith would not meet with any obstacle, and that many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
were willing to embrace it. Ansgar started in the year of
830, accompanied by Witmar, also of the Corvey convent.
They were well received by King Biœrn, and were able to
comfort many Christians in Swedish captivity, besides converting
some of the inhabitants. Among the converts was
the powerful Jarl Herger, who for a long period was the
chief supporter of Christianity in Sweden. After about a
year and a half, Ansgar and Witmar returned to the emperor,
who, satisfied with the result of their mission, erected
a special archbishopric in Hamburg for the spiritual needs
of the North. Ansgar was made the archbishop and, with
Ebo, archbishop of Rheims, apostolic legate among Swedes,
Danes and Slavs. At the same time, Gauzbert was made
the first bishop of Sweden under the name of Simon. He
went to Sweden and was well received by its king and people.
But a revolt against the new faith soon rose among
the heathens, not issuing from the king but from the people.
Gauzbert was captured and with contumely escorted out of
the country, while his relative, Nithard, was killed, thus
becoming the first Christian martyr in Sweden. For seven
years the country was without a preacher of the Gospel,
until Ansgar sent thither a new missionary, Ardgar, who
stayed there preaching until the death of Herger. In the
meantime Vikings had destroyed Hamburg, and not before
its bishopric had been united to that of Bremen was Ansgar
in a position to visit Sweden for a second time. This he
effected early in the fifties of the ninth century, coming this
time as a kind of ambassador from the kings of Denmark
and Germany to give more importance to his mission. The
heathen partisans, who recently had accepted the departed
King Eric among the gods, resented, and the reigning king,
Olof, dared not grant Ansgar the right to preach. The dif<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>ficulty
was solved through the ancient custom of throwing
dice. Ansgar was successful in the proceedings, and his
cause was then brought before the Thing (or Assembly) for
deliberation. The people decided that permission should
be granted to preach the Gospel, principally on the grounds
set forth by an old man who rose to remind the Thing that
the new God had already helped a good many, and that
it was a good thing to have him to fall back on when the
old gods failed. After having built churches and baptized
a great number, Ansgar returned home, leaving behind
Erimbert, a relative of Gauzbert’s. Archbishop Rimbert
was Ansgar’s successor, himself visiting Sweden. After
his death, the archbishops of the North seem to have
ceased taking interest in Swedish missions. The little
church, left to itself, soon succumbed. When at last one
of the archbishops, Unne, woke up to the necessity of visiting
Sweden, he found that the Gospel was forgotten. He
was himself surprised by death while in Sweden, and buried
in the town of Birka, in 936. Numerous graves of the
earlier Christians in Sweden have been found on the site
of the old commercial centre of Birka in the island Biœrkœ,
in the Lake Mælar, unburned bodies in wooden coffins, and
the graves without mounds.</p>

<p>King <i>Eric Edmundson</i> was a contemporary of Rimbert.
He was engaged in building up a Swedish dominion in Finland
and on the southern shores of the Baltic. With King
Harald Fairhair of Norway he was disputing the supremacy
over the province of Vermland. He was succeeded by
his son <i>Biœrn</i> who is said to have reigned for fifty years.
<i>Olof</i> and <i>Eric</i>, Biœrn’s two sons, succeeded him, the former
dying suddenly at a banquet. His young son, <i>Styrbiœrn
Starke</i> (the Strong), one of the most famous of Swedish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
heroes, demanded his share of the kingdom when only
twelve years old. When King Eric told him he was yet
too young, Styrbiœrn two springs in succession installed
himself on the mound of his father, by so doing making
claim upon his inheritance, according to old usage. But
when he came to the Thing to demand his share in the government
he was chased away with stone-throwing. King
Eric gave him sixty ships with men and weapons to try his
luck in Viking expeditions. Styrbiœrn won great fame
during several years of continual warfare in the Baltic,
capturing the mighty Jomsborg, a celebrated Viking nest
in the island of Wollin, later turning his weapons upon
Denmark, where he made the Danish king Harald Gormson
Bluetooth a prisoner. He now felt strong enough to attack
his uncle, King Eric. Harald Bluetooth was to help him,
but failed to do so. Styrbiœrn sailed with a fleet to Sweden;
after having landed he burned his ships to make a
return impossible. King Eric met him at the Fyrisvols
and fought a battle which was said to have lasted for
three days. Styrbiœrn fell, and with him the larger part
of his army. His uncle, the king, was after this called
<i>Eric Segersæll</i> (the Victorious). After the battle the king
ascended a high mound, promising a great compensation to
the one who could compose a song in praise of the victory.
The Icelander Thorvald Hialte, who never previously or
afterward appeared as a scald, came forth and recited two
strophes which are preserved to our day, receiving a costly
armlet of gold as reward. This battle&mdash;next to the one at
Bravols, the most famous in the heathen North&mdash;was fought
in 988.</p>

<p>King Eric invaded Denmark and took possession of the
country, making the son of Harald Bluetooth an exile, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
which facts Saxo, the Danish historian, testifies. In Denmark
Eric was baptized, the first Swedish king about whom
this is said. But upon his return to Sweden he also returned
to the old gods. Eric Segersæll was king of Sweden and
Denmark until his death, which occurred in 994. His first
consort, Sigrid Storrada (the Proud), from whom he later
separated, played quite an important part in the history of
her time. After the death of Eric, she married the exiled
Svend Tjufvuskægg (their son being Canute the Great),
who through this matrimony came to the throne of
Denmark.</p>

<p><i>Olof Skœtkonung</i>, the son of Eric and Sigrid, succeeded
his father. His surname is supposed to mean “the lap
king,” but he was no longer a minor at the death of King
Eric. King Olof was not a powerful or energetic ruler, like
the father. He let go, one after the other, the lands of his
crown. Denmark regained its independence, and he lost
also the scat-paying dominions south of the Baltic. Shortly
after Olof ascended the throne, the Norwegian king, Olaf
Tryggvason, had demanded Sigrid Storrada in marriage
and obtained her consent. But when King Olaf asked her
to become a Christian, she refused to change faith, whereupon
he insulted her. Sigrid told him that this should
cause his death. Two years later, when Sigrid was the
wife of King Svend of Denmark, she prevailed upon her
son and her husband to join hands in assailing Olaf Tryggvason,
who was expected back from an expedition to the
lands of the Vends. The compact was made, and the
Norwegian jarls, Eric and Svein, entered it. These all
collected an immense fleet, which assailed the unsuspecting
Olaf at Svolder, close by the coast of Pomerania. The
Norwegian king lost the day and his life. This famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
battle was fought in 1000, the kings of Sweden and Denmark
also taking a personal part in it. Norway was divided
between the victors. The Swedish king received as his
share the districts of Drontheim and Bohuslæn. These he
granted to Jarl Svein, who was the betrothed of his sister
Holmfrid. Fifteen years later they were recaptured by the
Norwegian king.</p>

<p>Olaf Tryggvason had been a devout Christian. His
sister Ingeborg was married to Jarl Ragnvald of West
Gothland, who was baptized and invited Christian missionaries
to Sweden. Through such influences King Olof Skœtkonung
was at last converted and baptized by Sigfrid, a
German missionary, at Husaby in West Gothland, in the
year 1008. Sigfrid, who has been supposed to be of English
parentage and a bishop of York, evidently came from
Germany. He preached for a long period in West Gothland
and Værend, in the latter district once being attacked
by heathen men, who killed three of his companions. King
Olof himself saw to it that the murderers were punished,
and Sigfrid continued his noble work without molestation.
He was later worshipped as a saint. Among other missionaries
who were active in converting the various provinces
may be mentioned the Anglo-Saxon St. David, the apostle
of Westmanland, the Anglo-Saxon St. Eskil and the Swede
St. Botvid, the apostles of Sœdermanland, and the German
Stenfi, or Simon, the apostle of Norrland. St. David was
a contemporary of St. Sigfrid, while the others were a few
generations younger. It was first through influence from
England and Denmark, during the reign of Canute the
Great, that Swedish conversions became more widespread
and general.</p>

<p>King Olof’s conversion met with a great deal of opposi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>tion,
especially in Svealand, which longest remained heathen.
Upsala, with its temple, was the heathen stronghold
of the North, and there the king had always, as one
of his principal duties, to preside over the great sacrifices.
King Olof was forced to accept the decision of a Thing
which granted him freedom to select some part of the kingdom
wherein to build churches and perform the duties of
the new cult, but which forbade him to use his influence
toward the conversion of his subjects. For this reason
Olof dwelt principally in the more and more christianized
West Gothland, in the capital of which province, Skara,
a bishop was installed. The name of the first bishop was
Turgot. Only after more than two centuries of endeavor
was the Christian Church firmly established in Sweden, in
the middle of the eleventh century; but even at that time
the great mass of the people were heathen in name. The
heathen party was so strong that it could for a long time,
and occasionally with success, keep up the battle against
Christianity. It took yet another century before the complete
victory of Christianity was an assured fact.</p>

<p>The reasons for the slow progress of Christianity in
Sweden were many, the principal one not being an opposition
to the Christian doctrines. The superstitious change
easily from one cult to another. The sceptics do not believe
more in one god than in another. Of heathen sceptics
there were a great many in the North who believed in nothing
else than their own strength. But it was the Christian
morals which were so difficult for the Swedes to accept.
Accustomed to great personal liberty, they could not endure
the restraint which Christian morals placed upon the
individual. The very spirit of Christianity, with its kindliness
and meekness, was not attractive to the Northman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
who in his own mental and physical force found a tower
of strength. The period of the first attempts at conversion
was not well chosen. The whole North was inflamed
by the Viking rage for war and plunder. Then followed
a period of disinterestedness when the good seed was sown
but the field neglected. Later the too arduous zeal of the
priests called forth criticism and resistance from the Swedes,
so tardy in making a decision and so careful in weighing
reasons for and against.</p>

<p>To this must be added the great prestige of the Upsala
temple as the heathen arc of worship in the North, and the
influence of the scalds and saga men of Iceland. Iceland
was discovered in 870, and settled principally by Norsemen
from the British Isles and from the western coast of Norway,
but also to some extent by Swedes and Danes. Sudden
and brilliant was the rise of Icelandic culture, and
Icelandic scalds overran the whole territory of the North.
At the court of every king and jarl these were at home,
sometimes in great numbers, and soon to the exclusion of
the native poets. For their poetry, both as to contents and
form, they were chiefly dependent upon the heathen myths
and traditions, and the result of their popularity must have
been a perfect heathen revival in those days of growing
scepticism. Through intercourse with Christians in Britain,
the Icelanders had borrowed many a noble trait, and their
taste found admirers in the old North, where such influence
must have been felt through centuries of indirect contact
with lands of classical or Christian culture. We are
told of the great number of southern coins found in Swedish
soil. Which travel further and faster, thoughts or
coins, and which are the more impressionable? So although
it would be unjust to deprive the Icelandic poetry, the im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>pressive
and grand Eddic songs and the more artificial
court-poetry, of any of its beauty or originality, it is not
right to ascribe all the culture, whose blossom it is, to Iceland,
or Iceland and Norway, to the exclusion of Sweden
and Denmark, or the Teutonic world at large. Good epic
poetry has been written all over Teutondom. In Sweden
strophes in the very metre of the majority of Eddic poems
have been found on tombstones. In the same manner with
the contents of the Eddic poems. Granting important exceptions,
we think that the heathen myths have been the
same in the East as in the extreme West. The very fact
that Icelandic court-poetry was accepted and enjoyed by
continental chieftains presupposes a thorough knowledge
and mastery of the more popular poetry of Eddic songs of
gods and heroes.</p>

<p>Hence the revival of heathendom in the North, by which
a king like Olof Skœtkonung for a long time was influenced,
finding his chief delight in the association with poets
and saga men.</p>

<p>In Norway, Olaf Haraldson had ascended the throne,
and he put an end to Swedish dominion in the Norwegian
districts. This caused strife, and also considerable annoyance
to the provinces touching the frontier. Popular feeling
rose high in Sweden, when the demands for a peace
guarantee with Norway were disregarded by King Olof.
Jarl Ragnvald sided with the people, desiring a union between
the Norwegian king and King Olof’s daughter Ingegerd.
At a great Thing held in Upsala, in 1018, King
Olof listened to Norwegian emissaries pleading for peace
and a royal marriage. Jarl Ragnvald complained of the
annoyance caused to his people of West Gothland. King
Olof became indignant, but was, through the forcible yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
dignified appeal for peace by Torgny, the <i>lagman</i> (justice)
of Tiundaland, compelled to a promise of peace and a concession
of marriage. But the king did not keep his promises.
A betrothal was arranged but soon annulled by Olof,
and the Norwegian king was in vain expecting his promised
bride. At the instigation of Jarl Ragnvald, Olaf
Haraldson married King Olof’s illegitimate daughter Astrid.
As this was done without the consent of her father, Ragnvald
dared not remain in Sweden. He went to Gardarike
(Russia), where he died shortly afterward, in 1019, his
widow, the princess Ingegerd, in Novgorod becoming the
wife of the Russian ruler Jaroslaf.</p>

<p>In Sweden, trouble was brewing against the king, who
had broken faith with his people, and in order to avoid
open revolt King Olof was forced to divide his power with
one of his sons, who, although yet a minor, was solemnly
elected king. He had in baptism received the name of
<i>Jacob</i>, which so displeased his heathen subjects that it was
changed to <i>Anund</i>. King Olof also agreed to maintain
peace with Norway, meeting his son-in-law at Konghæll,
in Bohuslæn, in 1019, for a peace agreement. King Olof
died two years later and was buried by the church of
Husaby, where he was baptized. He was the first king
who introduced coinage into Sweden. The earliest coins
were made of silver by Anglo-Saxons settled in Sigtuma,
and resemble closely Anglo-Saxon coins of the same period.</p>

<p>After the death of his father King Anund ruled alone.
He entered into an alliance with his brother-in-law of Norway
against Canute, who now was king both of Denmark
and England. During Canute’s absence, Anund and Olaf
invaded Denmark. In the subsequent strife between Olaf
and Canute, Anund took no active part. King Olaf had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
to flee to Russia. Upon his return he gathered an army
in Sweden, with the help of Anund, and entered Norway
through Jemtland. At Stiklastad he met the much superior
Norwegian army, and lost his battle and his life, in 1030.
After his death, the sentiment in Norway changed radically,
and he was worshipped as a saint throughout the
North.</p>

<p>Of Anund’s reign little is known. Adam of Bremen,
an ecclesiastic, whose history of the diocese of Hamburg
and Bremen, during the period 788-1072, is one of the most
important sources of Swedish history in heathen times, says
of Anund: “Young in years, he excelled in wisdom and
piety all his predecessors; no king was more beloved by the
Swedish people than Anund.” The historian gives as his
authority the Danish king Svend Estridsen, who as an
exile stayed at Anund’s court. Anund died in 1050 and
was succeeded by his older half-brother <i>Emund</i>, surnamed
<i>the Old</i>. He was the son of a freed woman, the daughter
of a Vendish chief. For this reason he had been passed
over at the first election. Emund was educated by his
mother’s relatives, was baptized, but was not much of a
Christian. He was popular neither with the new Christian
church nor with the people at large. Emund’s unpopularity
with the masses was caused by an agreement with
Denmark in regard to the boundaries when he ceded the
province of Bleking. Emund died in 1060. With him
the old royal line became extinct. A new line comes to
the throne of Sweden, where, with the general acceptance
of Christianity, a new era commences.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Early Christian Era&mdash;Stenkil’s Line and Interchanging
Dynasties</i></span></h2>

<p>The sources of Swedish history during the first two
centuries of the Middle Ages are very meagre.
This is a deplorable fact, for during that period
Sweden passed through a great and thorough development,
the various stages of which consequently are not
easily traced.</p>

<p>Before the year of 1060 Sweden is an Old Teutonic
state, certainly of later form and a larger compass than
the earliest of such, but with its democracy and its elective
kingdom preserved. The older Sweden, such as it
had existed at least since the days of Ingiald Illrade, was
in regard to its constitution a rudimentary union of states.
The realm had come into existence through the cunning
and violence of the king of the Sviar, who made away
with the kings of the respective lands, making their communities
pay homage to him. No change in the interior
affairs of the different lands was thereby effected; they
lost their outward political independence, but remained
mutually on terms of perfect equality. They were united
only through the king, who was the only centre for the
government of the union. No province had constitutionally
more importance than the rest, no supremacy by one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
over the other existed. On this historic basis the Swedish
realm was built, and rested firmly until the commencement
of the Middle Ages. In the Old Swedish state-organism
the various parts thus possessed a high degree
of individual and pulsating life; the empire as a whole was
also powerful, although the royal dignity was its only institution.
The king was the outward tie which bound the
provinces together; besides him there was no power of
state which embraced the whole realm. The affairs of
state were decided upon by the king alone, as in regard to
war, or he had to gather the opinion of the Thing in each
province; any imperial representation did not exist and
was entirely unknown, both in the modern sense and in
the form of one provincial, or sectional, assembly deciding
for all the others. The latter form is one of transition, the
modern form the ripe fruit, both brought out by the historic
development. In society there existed no classes. It
was a democracy of free men, the slaves and freed men enjoying
no rights. The first centuries of the Middle Ages
were one continued process of regeneration, the Swedish
people being carried into the European circle of cultural
development and made a communicant of Christianity.
With the commencement of the thirteenth century Sweden
comes out of this process as a mediæval state, in aspect
entirely different to her past. The democratic equality
among free men has turned into an aristocracy, with aristocratic
institutions, the hereditary kingdom into an elective,
or, at least, into one close upon turning into an elective,
kingdom, while the provincial particularism and independence
have given way to the constitution of a centralized,
monopolistic state. No changes could be more fundamental.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>For lack of sources the historians were, until quite recently,
led to the belief that the change was due to one
tribe in gaining the ascendency over another, the political
supremacy changing from one part of the country to another.
The epoch was called “The Struggle between
Swedes and Goths,” “The Struggle about the election of
kings between Swedes and Goths.” Now it is generally
admitted that the struggle was between principles, not between
tribes. The circumstances sometimes were such that
one section or province opposed others, but these divisions
never were identical or at all depended upon racial or tribal
conditions. It was a struggle between heathendom and
Christianity, democracy and aristocracy, provincial particularism
and centralized state unity.</p>

<p>The old provincial laws of Sweden are a great and important
inheritance which this period has accumulated from
heathen times. The laws were written down in the thirteenth
and fourteenth centuries, but they bear every evidence
of high antiquity. Many strophes are found in them
of the same metre as those on the tombstones of the Viking
Age and those in which the songs of the Edda are chiefly
written. In other instances the text consists of alliterative
prose, which proves its earlier metrical form. The expressions
have, in places, remained heathen, although used by
Christians, who were ignorant of their true meaning, as, for
instance, in the following formula of an oath, in the West
Gothic law: “Sva se mer gud hull” (So help me the gods).
The laws show a good many individual traits and differences,
but these are not of such a serious character as to
give evidence of having been formulated by tribes of different
origin. A remarkable exception is formed by the laws
of matrimony and inheritance for the inhabitants of Værend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
and Bleking, who, it will be remembered, are the descendants
of the Herulian immigration in historic times. In lieu
of a missing literature of sagas and poetry, these provincial
laws give a good insight into the character, morals, customs
and culture of the heathen and early Christian times of
Sweden. From the point of philology they are also of great
value, besides forming the solid basis of later Swedish law.
How the laws could pass from one generation to another,
without any codification, depends upon the facts that they
were recited from memory by the justice (<i>lagman</i> or <i>domare</i>),
and that this dignity generally was inherited, for
centuries being carried by the descendants of one and the
same family.</p>

<p>Interesting is the appendix to the law of the island of
Gothland, the Guta Saga, being the fragment of a history
of the island and its first contact with Christianity through
a visit by St. Olaf of Norway. The style is the same simple
and serene one as in the Icelandic sagas; while the Gutnic
dialect, in which it is written, more closely resembles the
Gothic of Bishop Wulfila in vowel sounds than the language
of any other known dialect. Quite an important appendix
is found in the older form of the West Gothic law, consisting
of lines of the kings of Sweden, with short but highly
valuable accounts of their reigns and characteristics.</p>

<p><i>Stenkil</i> was the name of King Emund’s successor. He
was a jarl and married to Emund’s sister. The statement
that he was born in West Gothland is not confirmed by the
authorities. His father’s name was Ragnvald, and it seems
likely that this Ragnvald was identical with the jarl spoken
of above, who died in Russia. Stenkil had close relations
with Russia, for his son Inge was called in from that country
to succeed his father. If Jarl Ragnvald was Stenkil’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
father, this only made his selection as king more plausible,
being then the half-brother of Isiaslaf of Russia and the
brother-in-law of the reigning kings of Hungary, France
and Norway. King Stenkil was a devout Christian, but
of a sagacious disposition, careful not to offend his heathen
subjects by any Christian propaganda. He was a giant in
size, and although phlegmatic, an ardent sportsman. Adalvard,
exiled by Emund, returned and did active work as
bishop of Skara, also converting the population of Vermland.
Even among the heathen of Svealand, Christianity
got a foothold, Adalvard the Younger being established as
bishop in Sigtuna, close by the pagan centre of Upsala.
But when he, in conjunction with Egino, of the newly erected
bishop’s chair of Lund, schemed for the destruction of the
heathen temple of Upsala, he was removed by the command
of the king, who found that such a plan, if carried through,
would prove disastrous to both Church and throne.</p>

<p>During the short reign of Stenkil there was a conflict
with Norway, an exiled Norwegian jarl having been granted
possessions in Vermland. King Harald Hardrade invaded
Gothaland, punishing this insult by a victory over the
Swedes. No further complications ensued, perhaps on
account of the close family relations of the two rulers.</p>

<p>Stenkil died in 1066, leaving two sons, <i>Halsten</i> and
<i>Inge</i>, both minors. During their minority two men, both
named <i>Eric</i>, relatives of Stenkil and the old royal line,
fought for supremacy, and both fell in the contest for the
crown. Hakon of West Gothland took hold of the reins of
state and kept them for thirteen years, until King Halsten
became of age, Hakon himself dying. Halsten was a devout
Christian like his father, but less sagacious, trying
to force the new faith upon the heathen of Svealand. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
this reason he was dethroned, and his brother Inge called
in from Russia. But King Inge was a Christian enthusiast
like his brother, and was subsequently driven away by the
irate inhabitants of Svealand, who now called to the throne
his brother-in-law <i>Sven</i>, surnamed <i>Blot-Sven</i> (<i>Sven, the
Sacrificer</i>), of heathen faith. The royal brothers dwelt
undisturbed among the Christians, but after three years
King Inge, in old heathen style, surrounded and set fire
to the domicile of Blot-Sven, who with all his household
perished within. King Inge resumed his reign, likely very
much in his old spirit, for two other pretenders, although
less formidable, appeared: <i>Olof Næskonung</i> (<i>Nose-king</i>)
and a son of Sven, called <i>Kol</i> or <i>Eric Arsæll</i>. Two papal
documents are preserved from Inge’s reign. They consist
of letters from Gregory VII., making appeals for closer
relations between the pope and the Swedish king.</p>

<p>An invasion was made from Norway, whose king, Magnus
Barfod, subdued the inhabitants of the province of
Dal. King Magnus built a fortified place on the island
of Kollandsœ in Lake Venar, close to the shore of
West Gothland, but it was captured by King Inge, who
set its occupants free, but without their weapons. Two battles
were fought at Fuxerna, the Norwegians being victors
in the first, the Swedes in the latter. Peace was effected
at a meeting between the two kings at Kunghæll in the
summer of 1101, when it was agreed that the frontiers
should remain as they were before the war. King Eric
Ejegod was also present at the meeting, where the betrothal
between King Magnus and King Inge’s daughter Margaret
was agreed upon. On account of the original nature of the
meeting the Swedish princess was surnamed Fredkulla
(Peace-Maiden).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1103 the bishopric of Lund was raised to the dignity
of an archbishopric, yet not becoming perfectly independent
of the archbishopric of Hamburg-Bremen. The archbishop
of Lund received the title of Primas of Sweden, preserved
long after Sweden had obtained its own archbishop.</p>

<p>King Inge died in 1111, receiving, by the appendix to
the West Gothic law, credit for “having ruled Sweden with
manliness, without breaking the law which governed each
province.” About his brother Halsten, who died before
him, the same source says: “He was sagacious and good-natured;
the cases brought before him were bettered, and
Sweden became worse through his death.” At the time of
Inge’s death, Jemtland was persuaded to pay scat to the
Norwegian king, but it remained in connection with the
church of Sweden.</p>

<p>Inge’s son Ragnvald died before him, and Halsten’s
sons, <i>Philip</i> and <i>Inge the Younger</i>, ascended the throne.
They were of a more peaceful disposition toward the heathen
than their predecessors, Christianity making great progress
during their reigns. Philip died in 1118, Inge following him
in 1125; his death was said to have been caused by poison.
The epitaph over the two runs thus: “Sweden fared well
while they lived,” in the terse language of the source quoted
above. With them the race of Stenkil became extinct in the
male line.</p>

<p>In 1123 the Norwegian king, Sigurd Jorsalafare, undertook
a crusade to the eastern parts of Smaland, which were
still heathen. “Crusades” of this kind were not uncommon
during that period, and were hardly anything else than
Viking expeditions in Christian disguise.</p>

<p>Great confusion ensued through the extinction of Stenkil’s
line. <i>Ragnvald Knaphœfde</i>, probably the son of Olof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
Næskonung, was chosen king, but lost his life through the
contemptuous neglect of an ancient custom. The newly
elected king should always make a tour of the realm, receiving
homage and giving assurance of his good faith to
the population of the various provinces. The provincial
laws had stipulations as to the nature and number of the
<i>gisslan</i> (hostages) to meet and escort him through each
province. This tour, called <i>Eriksgata</i>, Ragnvald undertook
without accepting hostages upon entering West Gothland.
He was killed at Karleby, in 1130, by the peasants,
indignant at what they considered an insult to all the West
Goths. These had, moreover, made another choice in Magnus
Nilsson, the son of Margaret Fredkulla in her second
marriage. Magnus never made claim to the Swedish throne,
endeavoring to become king of Denmark, after his father,
Nils Svendsen, but losing his life in the attempt.</p>

<p><i>Sverker</i>, who had married the widow of the younger
Inge, was in 1133 chosen king by the East Goths, and the
Up-Swedes (in the provinces north of Lake Mælar), having
no special choice of their own, also agreed on him. After
the death of Magnus Nilsson, the West Goths joined by
formally acknowledging King Sverker, who, born in East
Gothland, has been supposed to be the son of Eric Arsæll,
without solid reasons. During Sverker’s reign ecclesiastical
matters developed. The old bishoprics of Birka and Sigtuna
were changed into that of (Old) Upsala, where the pagan
temple seems to have been at last changed into a church.
New bishoprics were created in Linkœping, Strengnæs,
Westeros and Vexio. The whole of Swedish Finland
formed one diocese. The famous Bernard of Clairvaux
was asked by King Sverker and his queen Ulfhild to send
monks of his order, and several Cistercian convents were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
founded. The quiet and scholarly monks from France, no
doubt, soon began to exert a beneficial influence of importance,
through the means of their superior culture. A papal
legate, Nicolaus of Alba (later Pope Hadrian IV.), visited
Sweden in 1152, meeting all the dignitaries of Church and
State for a conference at Linkœping. The legate was willing
to give to Sweden an archbishop, but the matter was
postponed, since no agreement could be reached in regard
to the archbishopric’s seat. Measures for the establishment
of the Church on a firmer basis and the payment of Peter’s
pence to Rome were agreed on.</p>

<p>Sverker was a good and peaceful monarch, but seems
with old age to have lost some of his authority. A war
with Denmark was brought on through an escapade of his
son John, who had carried away two Danish women of
noble birth. He returned them, and was himself killed
by the peasants at a Thing. Yet the Danish king, Svend
Grade, had the excuse for an invasion and entered Smaland
with an army in the winter of 1153-54. The brave inhabitants
of Værend gave him a hearty welcome, and he soon
returned to Denmark. It is an old tradition that a woman
by the name of Blenda was chiefly instrumental in this
result. When the peasants feared to attack the superior
enemy, she had a splendid meal spread for the foe. After
the Danes had partaken heavily of its eatables and drinkables,
they were surprised and routed by their hitherto
invisible hosts and hostesses.</p>

<p>King Sverker, now called “the Old,” was murdered by
his valet while starting for the Christmas matins in 1155
or 1156. The murder was, without doubt, committed at
the instigation of the Danish prince Magnus Henricsson,
who on his mother’s side was a great-grandson of Inge the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
Elder, and who in this manner made his first attempt to
reach the throne of Sweden.</p>

<p>Already, in 1150, the Up-Swedes had in <i>Eric</i>, the son of
Jedvard, found a man in their opinion better suited to rule
Sweden than Sverker the Old. His mother is said to have
been the daughter of Blot-Sven and the sister of Kol, while
his father was “a good and rich yeoman.” Through a mistake
he was named <i>Eric IX.</i>, but is more commonly known
as <i>St. Eric</i>. One source calls him “lawgiver,” although
nothing is definitely known of his activity in this direction.
At the death of Sverker, his son Charles was certainly of
age, but the growing fame of King Eric made it useless for
him to force his right, and Eric was recognized as king
of the whole realm.</p>

<p>King Eric was a warm friend of the Christian propaganda
in his own country, and by crusades spread the faith
outside of its borders. It was only natural that Sweden
should turn its attention to Finland, with which country it
had stood in close relations since the remotest period, and
where Swedish settlements in all times existed. Accompanied
by Bishop Henric of Upsala, King Eric sailed with
a fleet to the southwestern part of Finland, or the province
now called Finland Proper, where the inhabitants were
forced to receive baptism. This crusade must have taken
place late in the fifties of the twelfth century. Eric soon
returned, but Bishop Henric remained with other priests to
have Christianity firmly established. These efforts met
with considerable difficulty, and Henric was murdered by
one of his converts. He was later worshipped as the patron
saint of Finland.</p>

<p>The pious King Eric was attacked by the perfidious
prince Magnus Henricsson at East Aros (the present or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
New Upsala), in 1160. It is said that Eric was attending
mass at the Trinity Church, when he was told of the approach
of his enemy. He remained till the service was over,
after which he went to meet his fate. He was overcome
and slain by the superior force. His pious life and virtues
and the miracles which were said to have been worked at
his grave made him the patron saint of Sweden, although
never canonized by the Church of Rome. His bones are
preserved in a shrine of gilt silver behind the high altar in
the cathedral of Upsala, and were in Catholic days objects
of worship. Oaths were taken “by the power of God and
Saint Eric the King,” his banner was carried in war, and
the city of Stockholm still has his image on its shield.</p>

<p><i>Charles Sverkersson</i> (<i>Charles VII.</i>) now made valid
his claims, the whole people rising to support him against
the usurper Magnus. In the following year Magnus was
killed by the indignant people. During the reign of Charles
some important novelties in Church and State were introduced.
Sweden received, in 1164, her first archbishop in
Stefan, a monk of Alvastra. The archbishop’s seat was
first Old Upsala. Instead of jarls in the various parts,
there is from this time on a jarl for the whole kingdom
at the side of the king, whom he assists in the government
of the state, sometimes obtaining a power rivalling that of
his master. The first jarl of the realm was Ulf, the second
Gutorm. The rivalry noticeable between the different provinces,
which all thought themselves called upon to select
a new line to rule after Stenkil’s, ceased at the death of
Saint Eric. What follows is a rivalry of interchanging
dynasties. Charles Sverkersson was, in April, 1167, surprised
by a pretender to the throne, Knut Ericsson, who
deprived him of crown and life, while his little son Sverker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
was saved and carried away to the queen’s uncle, Valdemar
the Great of Denmark.</p>

<p><i>Knut Ericsson</i> was the son of Saint Eric, and ruled
Sweden for twenty-five years in peace. In his youth he
had made one unsuccessful attempt to reach the throne,
after which he fled to Norway. After the death of King
Charles he had to fight two pretenders, Kol and Burislev,
the latter said to have been a son of King Sverker.</p>

<p>During this period the Baltic and its coasts were continually
disturbed by heathen sea-rovers from the southern
shores. A fleet of this kind entered Lake Mælar in 1187
and destroyed by fire the town of Sigtuna, which, as a
mercantile centre, had succeeded the earlier destroyed
Birka. The second archbishop of Sweden, John, was
killed by the invaders. The first preliminary plan for the
fortification of the present site of Stockholm was probably
then laid, in order to prevent further invasions, and a little
town commenced to grow up.</p>

<p>Conditions in Finland were not satisfactory. Invasions
by Esthonians and Vends were frequent, while the Finns
themselves were troublesome and little devoted to the new
faith. Bishop Henric’s successor was killed, but Sweden
continued to send bishops during the next hundred years.</p>

<p>The relations with foreign powers were peaceable, the
first known treaty between Sweden and a German prince
being entered into by King Knut and Duke Heinrich of Saxony
and Bavaria, in regard to trade relations with Lubeck.
King Knut died in the winter of 1195. He had four sons,
but although he had selected one of them for his successor,
“with general consent and through election by the foremost
men in Sweden,” <i>Sverker the Younger</i>, the son of King
Charles, succeeded him. That this could take place with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>out
serious objection of Knut’s sons can only be explained
by the influence wielded by the Church and the nobles.
The latter had already grown up to strength and importance.
Their leader was the mighty jarl, Birger Brosa, who
had succeeded Gutorm. He was of the influential family
of Folkungs, which, one of the first in the land, soon aspired
to the throne. Birger, himself married to a Norwegian
princess, gave his own daughter Ingegerd in marriage
to the new king, and remained in power.</p>

<p>King Sverker sought the favor of the Church by supporting
its claims. In a document of the year 1200, by
which he donates some property to the church of Upsala,
historians have seen the privileges extended to the Church
as an independent power of state, whose members could
be arraigned before an ecclesiastic forum only, and whose
property was to be exempt from taxation. This is the
spirit of the document; but the king had not, at that period,
the right to grant such extensive privileges. King
Sverker, and probably each of his successors, in turn, gave
only an assurance of their sympathy with the Church policy,
which was to its full extent an assured victory only toward
the close of the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>In 1202, Birger Brosa died, and with him the firm support
against the pretenders had fallen. The sons of Knut
now made open revolt, leaving their places at Sverker’s
court. In 1205, Sverker gave battle to them at Elgaros,
three of the brothers being killed and the fourth, Eric,
fleeing to Norway. But a few years later he returned
with an army, and Sverker found it safest to retire to
Denmark, whence he returned with a splendid army, which
King Valdemar II. Seier, had placed at his disposal. But
this army was defeated at Lena, in West Gothland, in 1208,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
and Sverker returned to Denmark, now turning to the pope,
Innocent III., who in vain threatened the pretender with
his ban. Sverker entered Sweden with a new Danish army,
but was killed at the battle of Gestilren, in West Gothland,
in 1210.</p>

<p><i>Eric Knutsson</i> now came to undisturbed possession of
the throne and thus remained until his death in April, 1216,
his reign being short and uneventful. He was the first
king of Sweden of whom it is known with certainty that
he was anointed and crowned, thus placing himself under
the protection of the Church. His queen, Rikissa, a sister
of Valdemar II., returned to Denmark after his death,
there giving life to a son, who was named Eric, after his
father. King Valdemar tried in vain to have this royal
babe placed on the Swedish throne.</p>

<p><i>John Sverkersson</i> succeeded King Eric, being, on account
of his fifteen years of age, first surnamed the <i>Young</i>,
later <i>the Pious</i>. By confirming and extending the rights
of the Church which his father granted he won the favor
of the ecclesiastics, and the attempts made by Valdemar to
have his consecration prohibited proved futile. Toward
the end of his short reign (in 1220) King John undertook
a crusade to Esthonia, where he left behind him his jarl,
Charles, a brother of Birger Brosa, and Bishop Charles of
Linkœping, with a part of the army. These all perished
in an onslaught made on them by the heathen in August
of the same year, and the ravages by Esthonians continued
as before. King John died in the island of Visingsœ, in
Lake Vetter, in 1222, like several of his predecessors, and
was, like them, buried in the monastery of Alvastra.</p>

<p><i>Eric Ericsson</i> now became king of Sweden. The royal
babe was then six years of age, a halting and lisping little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
creature. The Church took him under its protection, but
there was no powerful man to take hold of the government
during his minority. A pretender rose in the person of
<i>Knut the Tall</i>, a great grandson of St. Eric, like the king
himself. He defeated Eric’s troops at Olustra, in 1229.
Eric fled to Denmark, where he remained until the short
and restless reign of Knut came to an end through his
death, in 1232. Eric resumed the reins of government,
with the Folkung, Jarl Ulf, at the helm.</p>

<p>Pope Gregory IX., in 1230, gave commandment to the
Swedish bishops to rouse the people to opposition against the
ravages of the heathen in the Baltic provinces in the further
parts of Finland. In 1237 he commands the Swedish bishops
to have a crusade started against the heathen Tavasti
in the interior of Finland. This crusade took place under
the leadership of Birger Magnusson, who converted the
barbarous Finns by the sword and erected a fort on the
site of the later Tavastehus. Birger, according to Russian
testimony, tried to extend the dominion of Swedish
supremacy as far as to the river Neva, but was repulsed
by the Russians.</p>

<p>Peace had reigned in Sweden for some time when new
conflicts ensued. The peasants of Upland made an uprising
in 1247, but were conquered at Sparrsætra and punished by
heavier taxes. A pretender rose in the person of Holmger,
the son of Knut the Tall. He was captured and beheaded
in 1248.</p>

<p>A papal legate, Bishop William of Sabina, visited Sweden
and arranged, in 1248, an ecclesiastical meeting at Skenninge,
effecting the final separation of Church and State,
and establishing the former as an independent power at the
side of the latter. Archbishops and bishops were now to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
elected by the ecclesiastics and not by the king. Celibacy,
previously not enforced in the Swedish church, was then
introduced, meeting with a good deal of opposition; for the
ecclesiastical offices had already commenced getting hereditary,
as had in earlier times the combined dignities of Asa
priest and chieftain. Birger Magnusson had, shortly before
the meeting of Skenninge, succeeded Ulf as jarl of the
realm. This converter of the Tavasti was destined to play
a most important part in Swedish history, shaping its destiny
through the power of his iron will. He was the leader
of the Folkung family and party, a nephew of Birger
Brosa, and married to princess Ingeborg, a sister of the
reigning king. <i>Birger Jarl</i>, as he is generally called,
effected a satisfactory agreement with Norway at a meeting
with Hakon in the summer of 1249, according to which
the enemies of one realm should have no refuge, or support,
in the other. Besides, it was agreed that the son of the
Norwegian king should marry Rikissa, the daughter of
Birger Jarl.</p>

<p>King Eric died in 1250, at the age of thirty-four. He
called himself Eric III., while in later times, when St. Eric
was supposed to have been the ninth king of that name,
he has been called Eric XI. He was said to have been
peaceful, just and kind.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>The Mediæval State&mdash;The Folkung Dynasty</i></span></h2>

<p>With Eric Ericsson the royal line of Saint Eric
became extinct. The crown was, on account
of his birthright, offered to <i>Valdemar</i>, the oldest
son of Birger Jarl. He was crowned in Linkœping
in 1251. From this period on, a new historic source is
found in the rhymed chronicles, of which Swedish literature
possesses several elaborate ones of more than 22,000
verses in all. Of these the Old, or Eric’s, Chronicle, was
written about 1320, and, like all the rest, anonymously.
The verses are fine, the language pure and powerful; the
portraits of historical personages are roughly drawn but
interesting. Unfortunately these rhymed chronicles in
general, and the Eric’s Chronicle in particular, dwell rather
on the description of impressive events of pomp and splendor
than on historical facts; and the facts given are not
always reliable. The Eric’s Chronicle gives a brief review
of events during the reigns of Eric and Valdemar; then for
the events up to 1319 more fully.</p>

<p>According to the Eric’s Chronicle, Birger Jarl wished
to succeed Eric, but had to step aside for his son, who was
of royal descent through his mother, King Eric’s sister.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
But Birger Jarl remained the all-powerful, although uncrowned,
ruler till his death.</p>

<p>Many of the nobles were not satisfied with the election
of Valdemar. They joined forces, gathering hired troops
from Denmark and Germany. Birger met them at Hervadsbro
and defeated them, capturing the leaders, who were
beheaded. Among these were Philip, a son of Knut the
Tall, and Knut Magnusson, with others of the Folkung
family, which often was at war between themselves when
great interests were at stake.</p>

<p>After this battle peace reigned under the powerful and
sagacious rule of Birger. An assault upon Denmark by
King Hakon of Norway and Birger jointly was planned, but
a peace agreement took its place, in 1253. In the further
complications between Norway and Denmark, Birger took
no part. When later King Christopher of Denmark called
upon his northern neighbors for help against revolts in his
own country, these were ready to respond; but at the sudden
death of King Christopher these plans were frustrated.
In 1260 Birger bettered the already friendly relations with
Denmark, by arranging the marriage between King Valdemar
and the Danish princess, Sophia, whereupon he, himself
a widower, married Mechtild, a queen-dowager of Denmark.
In Finland, conditions were the same as of yore,
pagan tribes and Russian invasions rendering everything
unsafe and perilous. Birger renewed the trade agreement
with Lubeck, in 1251, with added privileges to Lubeck, but
with the stipulation that those of its citizens who settled
in Sweden must become Swedish subjects. In 1261 the
same privileges were extended to Hamburg. It was at this
period that the Hanseatic League was formed between the
commercial centres of North Germany. The relations be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>tween
the league and the Scandinavian countries waxed
quite intimate and, at times, menacing to the political
independence of the latter. But Sweden derived many
benefits through the contact with the reviving culture of
Southern Europe, which was brought about through the
Hanseatic League; the newly opened mining industry and
the prosperity of Swedish commercial centres particularly
owing much to this influence. Stockholm became the largest
and most important of Swedish towns during the days
of Birger, although he was not its founder. Also with
England, Birger was carrying on peaceful proceedings; yet
their purpose is not known. In 1237, the king of England
had granted the merchants of the island of Gothland free
trade privileges. Birger was a great and sound legislator,
although it is not known with certainty how many of the
judicial reforms accredited to him originated in these days.
He made the law that sister should have equal share
of inheritance with brother, and the laws of sanctity of
home, Church, Thing and woman, which formed the kernel
of a set of laws, later called <i>Edsœre</i> (Pledged oath), which
every crowned king and his foremost men must pledge
themselves to uphold. He tried to make away with the
ordeal of walking on, or the handling of, iron as a legal
testimony of guiltlessness. Further, he prohibited the custom
of self-imposed thraldom.</p>

<p>The only act of Birger’s which has been condemned was
his attempt to introduce feudalism. His second son, Magnus,
was created a duke, and received, at Birger’s death,
Sœdermanland, with the castle of Nykœping as a duchy.
This gave rise to much strife and many conflicts within
the new royal branch of the Folkungs, and endangered the
unity of the kingdom. Birger, the last jarl of the realm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
was the first real statesman of Sweden, whose stern intellect
and integrity of character won for his country an honored
position among its neighbors, and for himself the admiration
of many generations to come. He died in 1266.</p>

<p>The first few years after Birger’s death were peaceful.
The archbishop’s seat was removed to the present Upsala,
where work was commenced on the magnificent cathedral.
In 1271 the commercial privileges held by Lubeck and
Hamburg were also granted to Riga.</p>

<p>Valdemar was a weak and frivolous man, and his licentiousness
gave his brother Magnus the idea of pushing him
aside, and later deprived him of the loyalty and respect of
his people. The difficulties with his brothers ended in open
conflict; Magnus and his younger brother Eric turned to
Denmark and Germany, where they hired an army, King
Eric Glipping of Denmark helping them with troops on
promise of good securities. The brothers invaded West
Gothland and defeated a Swedish army at Hofva, in 1275,
while the king with his best troops remained inactive at
Tiveden. Valdemar fled to Norway, bringing his son Eric
with him. Venturing back into Vermland, he was captured
and brought before Duke Magnus. Valdemar went so far
as to abdicate his throne, but the meeting ended in an
agreement according to which <i>Magnus</i> was to become
king of Svealand and Valdemar to keep Gothaland. Eric
was made a duke, but died in the same year. Magnus
was crowned at Upsala in 1276.</p>

<p>King Valdemar did not long remain content with the
new state of things. One month after Magnus’s coronation
he arranged a meeting with him at Lœdœse, over which
King Magnus Lagabœte of Norway presided, but without
being able to effect an agreement between the brothers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Valdemar now turned to King Eric of Denmark, and won
an ally in him because Magnus had neglected to fulfil his
promises. Magnus gained a supporter in Duke Gerhard I.
of Holstein, whose daughter Helvig he married in November,
1276.</p>

<p>With the year 1277 war commences between Sweden
and Denmark. Magnus invades Halland and Scania, while
Valdemar, with a Danish army, enters Smaland, burning
the town of Vexio. With King Eric, Valdemar enters
West Gothland, capturing Skara. At last the Danes are
defeated at Ettak. Early in 1278 peace is made at Laholm,
Magnus promising to pay his debt to Eric, leaving the castle
of Lœdœse as security. Each promises not to shelter the
rebels against the other. Valdemar lost his cause and had
to give up Gothaland and his royal title, keeping only his
inherited estates. On account of his scandalous living, the
nobles insisted upon his imprisonment, and ten years after
his abdication he was placed in custody at the castle of
Nykœping. He survived all his brothers, dying in 1302.
His son Eric was imprisoned at the castle of Stockholm,
receiving good treatment like his father. When his cousin
Birger was crowned, in 1302, he was set free, spending the
rest of his life in Sweden as a private citizen. During
Magnus Ericsson’s minority he was a member of the king’s
council. When Magnus was sole occupant of the throne
he took the title of “King of the Swedes and Goths,”
which, occasionally used before, henceforward became the
customary one.</p>

<p>A revolt against King Magnus took place shortly after
the meeting at Laholm. Some of the nobles were dissatisfied
with the favoritism shown foreigners, a complaint which
was only too often justifiable, and forever repeated, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
course of centuries, against the Swedish monarchs. Count
Gerhard of Holstein was imprisoned, and the Danish
knight, Ingemar, killed. The king invited the rebels to
him at Gællqvist, where he in an unexpected way made
them prisoners, and had them beheaded, in August, 1280,
confiscating their property. This incident is characteristic
of the time, but there is no other authority for it than the
Chronicle. The reign of Magnus was comparatively short,
but a happy and glorious one. The relations with the island
of Gothland were made closer and more intimate, although
the proud independence of its inhabitants remained largely
intact. They were to pay increased scat, but continued
their government without royal officials. The Guts were
of Swedish origin, and their island formed since the ninth
century a part of Sweden, but their isolated position and
great commercial activity made them almost independent.
About the year 1000 they seek for themselves protection
from the Swedish king, and after their baptism they turn
to the bishop of Linkœping for spiritual guidance. Thanks
to its position, halfway between Germany, Russia and Sweden,
Gothland gives rise to the most important commercial
centre of Northern Europe after Lubeck. The inhabitants
of Visby were Germans, to a great extent, and their conflicts
with the rural population were frequent. King Magnus
appears as an arbitrator in such cases with an authority
great enough to impose his conditions. In spite of the
inimical relations between Denmark and Norway, Magnus
held peace with both.</p>

<p>As a legislator Magnus was even more important than
his father, shaping and reshaping laws which furthered the
development of the country and wielding an influence upon
its jurisdiction reaching down to the present day. At a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
meeting of nobles at Alnsnœ, in 1280, King Magnus gave
solemn pledge to the so-called Edsœre-laws of his father,
and made the nobility into a privileged class. All the men
surrounding him and his brother Bengt (made duke of
Finland), and on their estates, together with the trusted
men in the service of a bishop, were freed from paying taxes
to the king. The same privilege was extended “to all men
who served with a horse, whosoever they serve.” The exemption
from taxes did not include those due the church
or community, but only those due the king. The horse service
(<i>ross</i> = later <i>rusttjenst</i>) meant to provide for a cavalry
force of iron-clad men for military service, according to the
demands of the time. The nobles saw to it that this privilege
was made permanent even after they had discontinued
the horse service, and that others were added to it. A law
prohibiting <i>voldgæstning</i>, the custom of travellers of taking
by violence, or without compensation, food and comfort from
the rural population, was also made at Alnsnœ, and won for
King Magnus the rustic but beautiful surname of <i>Ladulas</i>
(Barn-lock). “For he wished to place such locks on the
peasant’s barn, that no one should dare enter but at the
will of the owner,” wrote Olaus Petri, the historian and
reformer. An official was placed in every country town to
see to the traveller’s comfort, and to his payment for it. At
a meeting in Skenninge, in 1285, a law about <i>konungafrid</i>
(royal sanctity) was made in order to prevent strife among
the nobles and to make away with the ancient evil of revenge
for bloodshed. This period of royal sanctity, when
between men of the most strained relations peace should
reign, commenced a fortnight after the king’s arrival had
been announced at the Thing and lasted until he had by
letter informed it of his departure out of the province. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
one who abused this sanctity, or only carried weapons, was
exiled and his property confiscated. Secret societies among
the nobles were prohibited.</p>

<p>Magnus was not only a great legislator, but saw to it
that his laws were not broken. Personally he loved splendor
and dignity, another trait through which he won the
favor of the Swedes, who in all times have been fond of
seeing their highest representatives surround themselves
with impressive luxury and wealth. Magnus was in this
respect the first mediæval monarch of Sweden, who kept
a brilliant court, but at the same time was the pious and
obedient son of the Church. He augmented the ecclesiastical
privileges and founded several convents. In one of
these, St. Clara of Stockholm, he installed his daughter
Rikissa. Upon his death, which deplorable event took place
in the island of Visingsœ, December 18, 1290, he was buried
in the Franciscan convent church (the Riddarholm’s) in
Stockholm, according to his own wish. He was the first
monarch to be entombed in this the present Pantheon
of Sweden. Three sons survived him, Birger, Eric and
Valdemar.</p>

<p>During the reign of Magnus, the development of mediæval
institutions took rapid strides. This is noticeable
also in the offices of those who surround the king. In
the place of the jarl have been set two new dignitaries the
<i>drotsete</i> and <i>marsk</i>, of the king, “the seater of the retinue”
and “marechal” or “servant of the horse,” respectively.
Circumstances heightened the importance of these offices
and changed them from court into state positions, the president
of the state council and the commander of the army.
The <i>kansler</i> (chancellor), often a bishop, is another important
royal office. The king’s council, consisting of bishops,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
knights and men of social standing, surrounds the monarch
at his command and according to his selection, the archbishop
being the only ex-officio member. Important affairs
of State and Church are decided on at the meetings of nobles,
<i>herredagar</i>, no one taking part who is not asked, or not
agreeable to the king. These meetings later developed into
<i>riksdagar</i>, at which all classes of the people were represented.
Taxes were collected for the king by bailiffs, who
in compensation received fiefs, sometimes consisting only of
certain estates, in other instances as much as a whole province
or district. The right of taxation belonged to the people.
Only in extraordinary cases the king was allowed to
impose additional taxes, although such were sometimes imposed
wrongfully, in spite of a law stipulated by King
Magnus Barn-Lock.</p>

<p><i>Birger</i> succeeded his father Magnus. He was only ten
years of age, but his father had placed by his side a man
who was to reign during his minority. Marsk <i>Tyrgils
Knutsson</i> was the second of the great uncrowned rulers
of whom Sweden was destined to receive a number almost
as large as that of illustrious monarchs. Tyrgils Knutsson
followed out the policy of peace and progress which Birger
Jarl had commenced and King Magnus continued, making
in all the happiest era of the Middle Ages. To Birger Jarl’s
conquest of Tavastland in Finland, Tyrgils added that of
Carelia. Two expeditions were sent to Carelia, in 1293 and
1299, whose savage inhabitants were converted and made
Swedish subjects. Viborg was built and formed a stronghold
for further operations, while Landskrona, another fortified
place, erected by Tyrgils, not far from the site of
the present St. Petersburg, was soon lost to the Russians.
Through the conquest of Carelia, better times commenced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
for the Church of Finland, whose bishopric, in 1300, was
moved to Abo.</p>

<p>The legislative work of his great predecessors was continued
by Tyrgils, who made possible the union of the various
“lands” of Upland into one judicial district. The first
justice was Birger Persson, who was at the head of the
work of preparing a common law for the whole province
(in 1296). Neutrality was preserved during the conflicts
between Norway and Denmark. King Eric Menved of
Denmark was, in 1296, married to King Birger’s sister,
the pious Princess Ingeborg. In 1298 Birger was married
to Eric’s sister Margaret in Stockholm, over the lavish
splendor of which event the poet of the Chronicle goes
into ecstasies of delight and felicitous description. Both
these unions were prearranged by King Magnus, and the
princess Margaret had been educated in Sweden for the
purpose of becoming its queen.</p>

<p>The king was now of age, but Marsk Tyrgils continued
for several years at the helm. His relations to the Church
show what a wise and vigorous statesman he was. When
in the name of the king the privileges to the Church were
once more granted, as by his predecessor, Tyrgils made the
important exceptions that the Church should fulfil for its
possessions the same military duty as all others in the country,
and that certain large fines should be reserved for the
king. The ecclesiastics took quietly to these restrictions at
first, but soon an open conflict ensued. Another and greater
one arose between the king and his brothers, Eric, duke
of Sweden, and Valdemar, duke of Finland. It resembles
very much the conflict between their uncle Valdemar and
his brothers. In both cases there was a weak and deceitful
king who was inferior, if not in wretchedness, at least in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
courage, to one of the brothers. After the first conflict was
ended, the dukes selected Marsk Tyrgils for their prey. In
March, 1305, Tyrgils saw the king grant to the Church the
important privileges held back until then. In December of
the same year the king and his brothers came upon Tyrgils
unprepared. He was imprisoned, and in a shameful manner
dragged to Stockholm, travelling night and day through
the cold of winter, probably by some fraudulent legal process
found guilty of treason, and beheaded, February 10,
1236. As a climax to this foul political murder, Tyrgils
Knutsson was buried on the place of execution. Later, his
body was removed to the church of Riddarholm and placed
at the side of King Magnus, whose son he had served so
faithfully.</p>

<p>The conflict between the royal brothers burst into flame
again, revealing some of the darkest and most shocking
scenes of deceit, treachery and villany found in Swedish
history. The strife commenced in April, 1304, for the first
time, and continued, with few and short intermissions,
until the autumn of 1318, with broken oaths and pledges,
which were renewed and broken again, alliances and royal
betrothals formed, ended and renewed, kingdoms and
duchies divided and redivided, endless intrigues, rebellion
and mutual invasions. The kings of Norway and Denmark,
with their armies, and several German princes and
hired troops, became actors in this bloody tragedy, which
ended in the annihilation of the principals. The most
dramatic incidents are known as “the Play at Hotuna”
and “the Feast of Nykœping,” both taking place during
the short intervals of peace. The former was enacted
September 29, 1306, when the king invited his brothers
to him at Hotuna in Upland. They accepted the invita<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>tion,
only to carry the king and queen away as captives,
forcing the former to give over to them his kingdom and
his power, only leaving him the royal title. “The Feast
at Nykœping” was held the night between December 10
and 11, 1317. The king and queen invited the dukes to
the castle, seized them in the night and threw them into
a dungeon, where they both perished after six months of
hunger and neglect. Birger did not derive any benefit from
his fearful crime. The whole country rose against him and
he died, after several years of exile, in 1321. Birger has
generally been held forth as the responsible party in the
crimes and evils of the conflict, but his brothers seem to
have been guilty in about the same degree. Duke Eric
was one of the most brilliantly gifted princes of his age,
and jealousy on the part of the king was the spark that
kindled the fire. But the bad example set by their father
of depriving an older brother of his throne, and the great
possessions and independence of the dukes, were the underlying
causes. The destruction of both the contending
parties was an unexpected solution and a great gain for
Sweden, whose fate appeared sinister, with the prospect
of dismemberment or dissolution, the dukes holding their
vast possessions as heirlooms.</p>

<p>During the conflict Norway had sided with the dukes,
Denmark with the king. Duke Eric was married to Ingeborg,
only child of King Hakon of Norway, and Duke
Valdemar to his niece of the same name. <i>Mattias Kettilmundsson</i>
was, in June, 1318, elected drotsete and regent.
He led an army against Denmark in the interests of the
duchesses, invading Scania and defeating the Danes near
Hessleholm. November 11th of the same year peace was
made in Rœskilde between the kings, Eric and Birger, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
one side, and King Hakon and the heirs of the dukes,
on the other. May 8, 1319, King Hakon died, and <i>Magnus
Ericsson</i>, the young son of Duke Eric, inherited the crown
of Norway, and July 8th of the same year he was elected
king of Sweden at Mora in Upland.</p>

<p>For the attainment of this end Magnus’s mother, Duchess
Ingeborg, and seven Swedish councillors had worked
with great activity. They had taken part in shaping the first
Act of Union of the North in June, 1319, and from Oslo,
in Norway, hastened to have Magnus elected at the Stone
of Mora, where the Swedish kings since time immemorial
were nominated. The Act of Union stipulated that the two
kingdoms were to remain perfectly independent, the king
to sojourn an equally long part of the year in each, with
no official of either country to accompany him further than
to the frontier. In their foreign relations the countries
were to be independent, but to support each other in case
of war. The king was the only tie to bind them together.</p>

<p>There was another Magnus whose candidacy was spoiled
by this union. He was the son of King Birger, already, as
a child, chosen king of Sweden in succession to his father.
Magnus Birgersson, a prisoner at Stockholm, was beheaded
in 1320, to make safe the reign of his more fortunate
cousin. King Magnus was only three years old, and
Drotsete Mattias Kettilmundsson presided over the government
during his minority, the nobles of the state council
having great power and influence. Both in Sweden and
Norway the nobility had by this time attained a supremacy
which was oppressive both to the king and the people, not
so much through their privileges as through the liberties
they took. Their continual feuds between themselves disturbed
the peace of the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1332, King Magnus took charge of the government.
He was a ruler of a benign and good disposition toward the
common people, whose interests he always furthered. But
he lacked strength of character and was not able to control
the obnoxious nobles. The provinces of Scania and Bleking
suffered greatly under Danish rule, which was changed into
German oppression when handed over to the counts of Holstein
as security for a loan. The people of Scania rose in
revolt and asked for protection from King Magnus. At a
meeting in Kalmar (in 1332) both provinces were united
to Sweden. But the king had to pay heavy amounts in
settlement, which were increased when Halland was procured
in a similar way.</p>

<p>King Magnus was, at his height of power, one of the
mightiest monarchs of Europe, having under his rule
the entire Scandinavian peninsula and Finland, a realm
stretching from the Sound at Elsinore to the Polar Sea,
from the river Neva to Iceland and Greenland. In 1335
King Magnus rode his “Eriksgata,” when he announced
that no Christian within his realm should remain a thrall,
thus practically abolishing the remnants of slavery. In the
following year he was crowned with his queen, Blanche
of Namur.</p>

<p>Magnus took great interest in legislation. During his
minority the provincial laws were revised. The king himself
accomplished the great and noble task of having these
united into a state law (<i>landslag</i>), appointing a committee
of three justices to do the work. The clergy was consulted,
but refused to have ecclesiastical laws made for the whole
kingdom. The state law was first considered in 1347, and
was put in practice in 1352, being both a digest and an
elaboration of the ancient provincial laws. In many an in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>stance
of foreign or domestic conflicts, the people, through
its enforcement, found help and shelter from the national
spirit of this law.</p>

<p>To the financial difficulties which beset the reign of King
Magnus and made his life a burden the great plague was
added. “The Black Death,” in 1350, came from England
to Norway and spread with great rapidity and the most
disastrous consequences throughout the North. In certain
parts of Sweden one-third of the population perished, in
other parts even a greater percentage, the plague raging
with equal violence throughout all classes of society. King
Magnus had for a long time contemplated revenge against
the invasions made by the Russians into Carelia. He undertook
an expedition, under the pretext of a crusade, which
ended badly, the Swedish fleet being shut in by the Russians
and saved only by means of digging a canal. The
king was severely criticised for this crusade, which was construed
as a punishment for his sins, and, besides, largely
increased his debts. The pope was among his creditors,
who, upon non-payment, placed Magnus under his ban.</p>

<p>The union with Norway was not a happy one. As a
minor, Magnus dwelt most of the time in Norway, but
later principally in Sweden. This was contrary to the Act
of Union, the state of things in Norway, furthermore,
necessitating the almost continual presence of the king.
For this reason his son, <i>Hakon</i>, was chosen king of Norway,
in 1343, Magnus remaining in power until Hakon became
of age, and his older son, <i>Eric</i>, chosen king, or heir-apparent,
of Sweden, in 1344. It appears that King Magnus
was in favor of this separation and had preconceived it in
giving to his older son the Swedish name of Eric and to the
younger the Norwegian name of Hakon, both equally char<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>acteristic
of the royal lines of the respective countries. The
two young kings caused their father considerable annoyance;
but, upon the early death of Eric, Hakon entered more
into harmony with King Magnus. Valdemar Atterdag, the
crafty and enterprising king of Denmark, took an active
part in the conflicts, pretending to support Magnus, while
simultaneously depriving him of Scania, Halland and Bleking,
which he captured almost without resistance. He
landed in the island of Gothland, plundering Visby in a
treacherous way. Upon his departure, his ships perished
in a storm, the plundered treasures going down with these,
the king himself escaping with difficulty. Valdemar arranged
a marriage between his little daughter Margaret and
King Hakon of Norway. Several Swedish nobles of great
influence considered the treachery and impudence of Valdemar
and the weakness of Magnus as going too far. They
offered the Swedish crown to Albrecht, the son of King
Magnus’s sister Euphemia. The offer was accepted by
Duke Albrecht of Mecklenburg, the father of the young
Albrecht, in behalf of his son. He made a sudden assault
upon Stockholm in 1363, capturing it. At the Stone of
Mora, Albrecht the Younger was chosen king of Sweden.
Magnus was defeated and made a prisoner at Enkœping.</p>

<p>King Magnus was taken to Stockholm and there imprisoned
for some time, heavily laden with chains. King Valdemar
deserted his cause, but the common people of Svealand,
with whom Magnus had always been exceedingly
popular, rose in order to free him. Soon King Hakon
reached the very gates of Stockholm with a Norwegian
army, whereupon Magnus was released. But he had to
abdicate his throne, leaving for Norway, where he died,
through an accident, in 1374.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Albrecht</i> was the rightful king of Sweden. At the
death of Eric he became heir-apparent to the Swedish
throne, but for having sped on the course of events in his
own interest, neither he nor his father acquired any popularity.
They surrounded themselves by a great number
of Germans, who, through their licentiousness and overbearing
manner, enraged the people. The country was
practically in the hands of a few Swedish nobles, among
whom the drotsete, Bo Jonsson Grip, through his high
office and his immense wealth, bore the supremacy. Bo
Jonsson is said to have been the wealthiest man who ever
lived in the North, his possessions, fiefs and castles being
of an astounding number, the most famous among the
latter being Gripsholm in the Lake Mælar. He loaned
money to the king against new castles and fiefs in security,
and held Albrecht in the most humiliating relation of
dependence. His enemies he persecuted without mercy,
killing one before the high altar in the Franciscan church
of Stockholm. When Bo Jonsson died, in 1386, the king
tried to better conditions by confiscating to the crown some
of his possessions. But he met with opposition from the
nobles, who claimed that he did so only to enrich his German
favorites. The king was helpless against his councillors,
to whom he had handed over all his power. They
were in possession of all the fortified castles, and if one
of them died, the king had no right to select a successor
without their permission. The executors of Bo Jonsson’s
will ended by offering the crown to Margaret, Valdemar’s
daughter, and queen-dowager of Norway. She accepted,
promising the nobles that they should remain in undisturbed
enjoyment of their great privileges. Margaret sent an army
into West Gothland, consisting of men from all three of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
Scandinavian countries, under the command of the Swede,
Eric Kettilsson. King Albrecht met with an army to a
great extent composed of German troops, and was defeated
and made a prisoner at Falkœping, February 24, 1389.
Albrecht was imprisoned at Lindholm, in Scania, for
seven years, later returning to Mecklenburg.</p>

<p>To the Folkung period belongs one of the most remarkable
and renowned of Swedish women, herself, on her
mother’s side, a Folkung, <i>St. Birgitta</i>, the daughter of
the legislator and first justice of Upland, Birger Persson.
Her parents were both pious and devoted to ascetic practices.
As a child she had visions, the holy Mary appearing
to her. When thirteen years of age she was married to Ulf
Gumundsson, later justice of Nerike, also a pious man, with
whom she made a pilgrimage to Spain. Birgitta lost her
husband shortly afterward. At the Swedish court, where
she was the highest functionary of Queen Blanche, she had
seen political life at close range, gathering a deep and
strong indignation against the mighty and powerful in
the world. Her husband’s death moved her deeply, and
the religious mysticism of her youth now burst forth with
increased strength, her visions becoming numerous and important.
That she believed in them herself there is no
doubt, and she made the world believe her. At first she
hurled admonitions and curses against King Magnus and
his court; but the wretchedness of the whole world attracted
her to its spiritual centre, Rome, where she lived for twenty-three
years in continual and open protest against the vices
of the popes and priests. She died in Rome, in 1373, at
the age of seventy, after a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, seeing
the two great ambitions of her life fulfilled: the pope returning
to Rome from Avignon, and her creation, the order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
of St. Salvator, sanctioned by the pope. Birgitta was canonized
by the pope in 1391, through the influence of Queen
Margaret.</p>

<p>Birgitta was the greatest political-poetic genius of the
mediæval North. Her revelations fill eight volumes. She
wrote them in Swedish, and had a priest translate them
into Latin. Some of her original Swedish work is preserved.
Birgitta appears to have thought in artistic images,
and these images are of plastic form, often of consummate
beauty, sometimes witty, sometimes avowedly comic, always
effective. The melancholy charm of Sweden’s nature suffuses
all her writings and renders to her peculiar mediæval
mysticism a national temperament. From Swedish sceneries
and animal life she borrows her most beautiful images.</p>

<p>St. Birgitta has by some been considered as a reformer
before Luther, but not quite correctly. Luther reformed the
institutions; Birgitta aimed at reforming their upholders,
and used against the pope and the priests a language almost
as strong as Luther’s. Some of her ideas were not strictly
in harmony with the Catholic dogmas; she insisted on a
close personal union with God, without the mediation of
priests or saints, fought for a universal knowledge of the
Bible and the preaching of the Gospel in the popular vernaculars,
and considered the sale of indulgences a mortal
sin. Four hundred and seventy convents of her order, in
which men and women were to collaborate for the instruction
and spiritual guidance of the people, were after her death
founded in the Scandinavian countries, Germany, Esthonia,
Poland, Italy and the Netherlands, one existing in England
up to the time of Elizabeth. The mother institution at
Vadstena, in East Gothland, was of the greatest importance
to the cultural development of Sweden and the North.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
One of the greatest libraries of the Middle Ages was reared,
and the first book-printing establishment of Sweden founded
there in 1490. Within its walls a considerable literary activity
prevailed, the religious literature of the time being
copied, or translated into Swedish, and many original works
written. The Swedish language, used by the Birgittine
school of writers, tried, by approaching Danish forms, to
establish a common literary language in the North, the
Norwegian having approached the Swedish during the
time of the close relations between the courts of the two
countries. These efforts, for a time furthered by political
relations, were unfortunately soon to be abandoned forever.</p>

<p>Birgitta was a great genius in fetters. Her rare gifts
were kept back in their development through the idiosyncrasies
of her period. She was of an indomitable, aristocratic
spirit, always remaining the noblewoman to whom
it was natural to speak the truth to the princes of State and
Church, because she considered herself their equal through
the best blood of the North, of which she had her share.
This religious mystic was a true child of her aristocratic
age, which gave to Sweden two parallel lines, sometimes
identical, of great legislators and weak and indulgent
princes.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Unionism versus Patriotism&mdash;Margaret, Engelbrekt
and Charles Knutsson</i></span></h2>

<p>Queen Margaret, the successor of Albrecht, for
the first time in history united the three Scandinavian
countries and their dependencies under one
rule. Born in a prison in which King Valdemar of Denmark
had placed his consort, Queen Hedvig, there remained
in the character of Margaret something of the rigor and
chill of her uncomely birthplace. When she was seven,
she was engaged to King Hakon of Norway, and married
to him at eleven years of age. In Norway, her education
was continued for several years after her marriage under
the stern supervision of Dame Martha, a daughter of
St. Birgitta, who often applied corporal punishment to the
young queen. Margaret early gave evidence of self-control
and power of reflection, and her mind developed at the expense
of her heart. Her son Olaf became king of Denmark
upon Valdemar’s death, in 1375, and king of Norway upon
that of Hakon, in 1380. Upon his death, in 1387, Margaret
succeeded him, and two years later laid Sweden under her
sceptre.</p>

<p>Albrecht was captured, but the Germans still were in
possession of several Swedish strongholds. These yielded
to Margaret, one after the other, except Stockholm. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
capital, the German influx of soldiers and merchants had
made the foreign population exceedingly large. They now
acted as oppressors. A secret league was formed which
captured a great number of prominent Swedish citizens,
who were cruelly tortured with wooden saws and then
thrown into an old shed on the islet of Kæpplingeholm.
The shed was ignited and the poor prisoners suffered a
terrible death. German freebooters, especially the Vitalen
or Victuallen Brotherhood, who provided the fortress of
Stockholm with victuals, were plundering in the Baltic
and Lake Mælar, and were the allies of the Germans of
Stockholm. Margaret was powerless against them until
she entered into an alliance with the Hanseatic towns.
This ended the war; Stockholm surrendered and peace
was made, in 1395. The plunders by sea-rovers in the
Baltic were put an end to during Margaret’s reign, but
cost heroic efforts and much money, while the influence
of the Hansa grew into menacing proportions.</p>

<p>Margaret was anxious to place the dynasty of the North
firmly within her line of descent. In 1389, she selected her
sister’s grandson, Eric of Pomerania, then six years old,
her successor, and he was thus proclaimed in Norway. In
1395, Eric was chosen king of Denmark and, in 1396, of
Sweden. At his Swedish coronation in Kalmar, in 1397,
Queen Margaret, who remained at his side as the real ruler,
had the outline drawn of an <i>Act of Union</i>, which should
forever unite the three Scandinavian kingdoms under one
ruler. Each country was to preserve its constitution, laws
and traditions unmolested, but they were to support each
other in times of war. When a king was to be chosen,
representatives of equal numbers from each country were
to meet in Halmstad, the sons of kings to be favored by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
choice. This Act of Union was never carried into effect,
according to legal forms. The sketch or outline of it, such
as it is still preserved, was signed by representatives of the
three countries, although not in equal numbers; but why
Queen Margaret never allowed it to be enlarged into a
legally binding document is not known. Her favorite
idea was therein embodied, and she appeared to have an
all-powerful influence over those necessary to carry it
through.</p>

<p>Margaret made it her object to strengthen the crown
and reduce the power of the nobles. She cared naught
about keeping her promises to the latter, confiscating their
castles and possessions, and annulling their privileges.
When they complained, reminding her of her promises in
her letters to them, she replied: “Keep my letters; I shall
certainly keep your castles.” All nobles created by Albrecht
were entirely deprived of their privileges if they
could not prove their due qualifications. The majority of
forts erected during the war were pulled down. No taxes
were longer imposed, except through written order of the
government. These reforms were all rigorously carried
out, according to the “Restitution of Nykœping” of 1396.
Margaret succeeded in a remarkable way in reducing to
normal proportions the power and influence of the Swedish
nobility. The nobles, who were all-powerful and absolutely
unyielding in Albrecht’s days, bowed to her gracefully
and received meekly her severe conditions. An
explanation can be found in the fact that they had no leader
of authority and power among them, after the death of
Bo Jonsson Grip. Further, Margaret was careful not to
fill the important offices of drotsete and marsk, when
vacant, thus making the personal presence and inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>ference
of the sovereign necessary on all important
occasions.</p>

<p>The love of the Swedish people should have been Margaret’s
reward for her abolition of aristocratic oppression,
if she had not been in a position which necessitated the
imposition of heavy taxes. The existence of the common
people was made weary and troublesome through the payment
of the “queen’s tax,” the “stake tax” on each hearth,
the “rump tax” on each head of cattle, and, worst of all, the
“Gothland’s release.” Bailiffs, often of foreign birth, collected
these taxes with great severity. When the queen became
aware of the complaints against her and her bailiffs,
she asked in a letter to the archbishop that the people would
forgive her in God’s name. “Some of it one has not been
able to better; some we and they might well have bettered,
although what is done is done.” Without doubt, there was
due reason for the heavy taxes in the unsettled relations
with other countries which existed during Margaret’s reign;
the support of the Hansa and a war with Holstein, commenced
by King Eric, were expensive. The island of Gothland
had been captured by the so-called German Order in
the last days of Albrecht’s reign. When the island was redeemed
through the payment of Swedish money, Margaret
made the mistake of installing there a Danish bailiff, and
it thus for a long time remained a Danish province. Margaret
believed in the Union and counted no Scandinavian
a foreigner in either country. But it was contrary to Swedish
law to install foreigners as bailiffs and vassals, and as
she appointed a great number of Danes to Swedish fiefs,
and never a Swede to Danish positions of the same or
equal importance, the Swedish complaints, on this point,
were justified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>Margaret was as severe toward the ecclesiastics as
toward the nobles. But when she noticed the forebodings
of powerful resistance, she made important concessions.
She was anxious to observe religious practices, joining the
convent of Vadstena as a “worldly sister,” kissing the hands
of all the monks and nuns on that occasion. She took interest
in the conversion of the Laps, sending a baptized woman
of their race, by the name of Margaret, to preach the Gospel
among them.</p>

<p>The war with Holstein concerning the possession of
Schleswig had been brought to an armistice, and the
queen sailed to Flensburg to conduct further negotiations.
While still on board of her ship, death surprised her, in
1412.</p>

<p>Margaret has been called the Semiramis of the North
and well deserves her widespread fame. During her reign,
the Northern countries, through her wisdom and strength,
enjoyed a degree of order which they missed both before
and after. She put an end to the foreign influence which
had governed Sweden. Yet her rule was a disappointment,
and the Union also. She paved the way for a new foreign
influence, by making a German prince her successor and
by leaning too much on the Hansa. The aristocratic oppression
was crushed by her, but she introduced the oppression
through royal bailiffs. She promised to preserve the
old territory of Sweden unmolested, but placed the island
of Gothland under Denmark. The Union of which Queen
Margaret was the champion her successors were not able
to grasp or uphold in the spirit of her good intentions. To
Sweden it came in an inauspicious time when it was not
fit to receive it. Foreign oppression had irritated the people
to resistance, and discontent was to give life to patriotism.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
Sweden had recently developed into one joint constitutional
body, the various provinces giving up their ancient
laws for a state law, in which the old individual
traits were gathered and recognized. We know how Sweden
was settled, not by various tribes, but by pioneers who,
from the old home of culture, Scania, penetrated to the
wilderness above, settling one district after the other,
which, one by one, developed into provinces, little states
by themselves, later united into one realm with a common
king. One by one these provinces had taken the lead in
the political and cultural development, often the youngest
before the oldest. Thus the Swedes, a younger branch of
the Gauts, gave their name to the country and furnished
the rulers, the Guts of the island of Gothland securing the
commercial supremacy of the sea, and the Rus of the outskirts
of Upland founding the Russian empire. Now it fell
upon Dalecarlia, the most recently settled of Swedish provinces,
to save freedom and independence to a newly regenerated
state which was awakening to the consciousness of
its solidarity of interests, aspirations and duties. From
Dalecarlia came the first great political leader. From there
he and his later successors received their chief support.</p>

<p><i>Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson</i> is the earliest and greatest
of the patriotic heroes of Swedish history. To the glory of
his deeds and the noble simplicity of his character the death
of a martyr gives added lustre. Engelbrekt was born at
Kopparberg, in the mining district of Dalecarlia, where
there were many German settlers. Possibly his early ancestors
were among them; but for three generations at least
they had been native-born Swedes, Engelbrekt’s father,
as he himself, belonging to the Swedish nobility, although
not of the influential families. Engelbrekt had received the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
chivalric education of his time at the courts of the great
nobles, being next in rank to a knight, <i>væpnare</i> (squire),
at the opening of his career. He was small of stature, but
eloquent, courageous and of a lofty mind. The integrity
of his character was absolute; his personal necessities were
few and plain.</p>

<p>King Eric was a highly educated and refined man, not
without a certain ability, but entirely without discernment
and patience for the various demands and conditions of the
countries over which he was set to rule. His foreign bailiffs
in Sweden, mostly Danes, with a fair sprinkling of
Germans and Italians, were still less in sympathy with his
Swedish subjects. They tried to manage them as they did
the Danes and the inhabitants of more southern countries,
for centuries accustomed to slavery, ignorant of the ancient
spirit of independence of the Swedish yeomanry, abated
but not suppressed. When oppression no longer kept within
reasonable bounds, the Swedish patience came to an end,
and first in the youngest and most solitary parts of the
country.</p>

<p>The most hated of Danish bailiffs was Jœsse Ericsson,
of Westmanland and Dalecarlia. After having confiscated
the horses of the peasants, he is said to have harnessed the
men to plows and the women to grain-loads, once suffocating
five peasants. Engelbrekt felt compassion for the
misery of the suffering people and accepted the commission
to seek the king, to make complaints in their behalf. He
appeared before King Eric in Denmark, demanding punishment
of the cruel bailiff and offering to go into prison or
surrender his life if not speaking the truth, as was the
custom of the time. The king gave him a letter to the
Swedish council of state, demanding an inquiry which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
promptly made. When Engelbrekt for a second time appeared
with the corroboration of his statements from the
Swedish councillors, the king sent him away in a fit of
impatient rage. Upon his return, the Dalecarlians rose
in a body, selecting Engelbrekt as their leader and marching
south to Westeros. The councillors met and promised
to have justice done in the case. But things remained the
same until the following spring, in 1434. At midsummer
the Dalecarlians commenced operations. The fort of Borganæs
and the castle of Kœping were destroyed. Engelbrekt
asked the people of Westmanland to join him, which
they did to a man, the nobles also joining upon evidence
of the determination of the popular leader. In Upsala,
Engelbrekt found the people of Upland ready to join, and
he made clear to the great multitudes the mission he had
undertaken. He now felt strong enough to take a hand
in the affairs of state; with the consent of the leading
nobles reducing the taxes by one-third. Engelbrekt called
upon a young, high-spirited nobleman, Eric Puke, to bring
Norrland to revolt and destroy the forts of that district,
which commissions Puke fulfilled to the letter, thereupon
reinforcing Engelbrekt with his men. In the meantime,
the people of western Sœdermanland rose by their own
determination, destroying Gripsholm; the bailiff of the castle
escaping with his treasures in boats over Lake Mælar.
In Vermland and Dal the people followed these examples
of revolt. The commander of the Stockholm fortress agreed
upon an armistice, other castles surrendering or promising
to surrender.</p>

<p>Engelbrekt met the council of state at Vadstena, escorted
by 1,000 men of his best troops. Without fear or haughtiness,
he pleaded the cause of his country, advising the coun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>cillors
in firm and eloquent words to see to it that the foreign
oppression came to an end. The council hesitated,
Bishop Knut of Linkœping stating that the oath to the
king could not be broken. To this Engelbrekt answered
that the king had pledged many oaths but kept none,
for which reason the people were freed from their oath.
Upon a wholesome demonstration of force the councillors
gave in and dictated a letter in which they broke their
pledge to King Eric, yet giving as an excuse that they
were compelled to do so. The revolt had now spread to all
parts of the kingdom, at least 100,000 being armed to meet
the emergency. But so carefully and quietly was the work
of liberation performed that no harm was done in the parts
where the peasant armies were moving. After having
entered Halmstad, Engelbrekt returned to Westeros, where
the army was scattered, but soon gathered again upon the
report that the king with a fleet was approaching Stockholm.
Upon his arrival, the king found Stockholm enclosed
by a peasant army and returned to Denmark, forced
to agree to an armistice. At a meeting in Arboga, Engelbrekt
was elected regent. This was the first meeting in
which representatives of the merchant class and the yeomanry
took part, being thus the first <i>riksdag</i> or parliament
composed of the four Estates&mdash;noblemen, ecclesiastics,
burghers, and yeomen.</p>

<p>King Eric promised, upon his return to Stockholm, to
govern the country according to its laws and through Swedish
men, appointing Krister Nilsson Vasa drotsete, and
Charles Knutsson Bonde marsk. But so badly did he keep
his promises that he was once more dethroned. The nobles
hastened to elect Charles Knutsson regent, but through
pressure which the peasants brought to bear it was agreed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
that he should share his power with Engelbrekt and lead
the siege of Stockholm, while the latter should free the
country from the bailiffs reinstalled by the king.</p>

<p>Upon his second tour through the country, Engelbrekt
was seized by illness, but being called to Stockholm by an
important state affair, he started over the lakes thither from
Œrebro. One evening he stopped at an islet in Lake Hielmar
for the night. When he saw a boat approach with
Mons Bengtsson on board he staggered on a crutch down
to receive him. This man sprang ashore and assaulted
Engelbrekt, who tried to ward off the blows of the axe
with his crutch, but failing to do so he was killed on the
spot, in April, 1436. The perpetrator of this beastly murder
was a son of a noble with whom Engelbrekt had been
engaged in some controversy which he had recently settled
to the satisfaction of both parties. The murderer escaped;
but, although shielded from punishment by Marsk Charles
Knutsson, he was shunned by everybody, his high-born and
wealthy relations for several centuries refusing to carry the
proud family name (Natt och Dag) upon which he had
brought shame.</p>

<p>The memory of Engelbrekt is one of the most honored
and most beloved in Swedish history. He waged the first
battle against the oppression which foreign intrigues had
brought upon his country, and saved from the peril of
slavery the ancient freedom and independence of the Swedish
people.</p>

<p>Through a remarkable coincidence, a cousin of Engelbrekt’s
murderer, Nils Bosson, a young follower of the
popular hero, who took his mother’s family name of Sture,
was to become the father and grandfather of two of the
most revered of Engelbrekt’s successors; Nils Bosson him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>self
being as sympathetic and upright a type of nobleman
as any time or country has produced.</p>

<p>Charles Knutsson, after Engelbrekt’s death, was the
most influential man in Sweden. But he was a very different
man. Belonging to the highest aristocracy, he was himself
of great wealth, highly talented, well read, and a great
traveller. He was exceedingly handsome, dignified, amiable,
eloquent, and possessed a voice of unusual charm and
strength. But he was a prey to ambition, determined to
make his way to the throne, but little careful in the selection
of his means toward that end. He aroused the suspicion
and hatred of Eric Puke, whom he irritated to revolt
only to get him in his power. This noble but headstrong
man was executed for treason, while Drotsete Krister Nilsson,
who signed the death-warrant in the interest of
Charles, himself was persecuted by the latter and deprived
of all his fiefs save one. Charles showed great severity in
punishing the peasants, who were Puke’s supporters, four
of them being burned alive; thus losing the popular
sympathy, while becoming an object of envy in the
eyes of the nobles. These recalled King Eric, who
was again found impossible and soon dethroned also in
Denmark.</p>

<p><i>Christopher of Bavaria</i>, a nephew of Eric, was elected
to succeed him (in 1440) by the nobles of Denmark and
Sweden. He was a good-natured man, who allowed the
aristocrats of Sweden to rule as they pleased, only keeping
an eye on Charles Knutsson. Christopher died in 1448.
During his reign a new state law was issued in 1442, called
“King Christopher’s land’s law,” although the king probably
had very little to do with its form or stipulations. It
offered a few improvements, but in general so closely resem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>bled
the older state law that the one was often mistaken for
the other and both remained valid until 1736.</p>

<p><i>Charles Knutsson (Charles VIII.)</i> returned from Finland,
which duchy had been held under his supremacy, four
months after Christopher’s death, and was by an overwhelming
majority elected king of Sweden. Shortly after
his coronation at Upsala he was elected king of Norway
and crowned at Drontheim, in 1449. His reign opened with
a lucky expedition to the island of Gothland. But in the
following year King Charles lost both Gothland and Norway
to Christian of Denmark, with whom the Unionist
party of Sweden entered into secret plots against the king.
Invasions and intrigues followed. Christian invaded Smaland,
East Gothland and Vermland, to which Charles
responded by an invasion of Scania, destroying the old
town of Lund with nineteen of its twenty churches, the
cathedral alone being spared. Christian took revenge by
an invasion of West Gothland, capturing Lœdœse. Another
Danish army marched through East Gothland, but
met defeat at Holaveden through an onslaught made by
Swedish peasants. The valiant Tord Bonde, a cousin
of King Charles, took the Danes by surprise, recapturing
Lœdœse. An armistice of two years was agreed on, in
May, 1453.</p>

<p>In the battle against open and secret enemies things
turned out badly for King Charles. The best supporter of
his cause, his cousin Tord, was murdered by a Danish traitor
in his service, in 1456, and a new and dangerous enemy was
encountered in the Church. The king had confiscated to the
crown a number of estates which the Church had gained
in an illegal way. While preparing for an expedition to
Œland, and having instructed the archbishop to gather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
troops for him, Charles learned that this man, Jœns
Bengtsson Oxenstierna, had turned against him. The
archbishop deposited his ecclesiastical robe at the high
altar of the Upsala cathedral and started, sword in hand,
with his forces to meet the king. Charles tried to surprise
him, but was himself caught in a trap and met his enemy
on the ice of Lake Mælar. The encounter proved a defeat
to Charles, who in haste stored his treasures in a convent
in Stockholm and sailed for Dantzic.</p>

<p><i>Christian</i> of Denmark was called in by the archbishop
and chosen king of Sweden. Christian was a sagacious
ruler, but his great need of money, incurred by the redeeming
of Schleswig and Holstein, made him unpopular. As
the easy-going Christopher had been surnamed “Bark-king,”
on account of dearth experienced in Sweden during his
reign, when the people had to mix bark with their flour,
thus Christian, on account of his avidity, was called “The
Bottomless Purse.” During Christian’s war with Russia,
the archbishop was commissioned to collect the increased
taxes, but failing to do so, to the full extent demanded,
he was imprisoned at the command of the king. This
caused indignation.</p>

<p>Kettil Karlsson Vasa, a nephew of the archbishop, and
the bishop of Linkœping, revolted and defeated the king
and his army at Haraker’s church, in Westmanland, in
1464. The victors then marched on Stockholm. The popular
opinion of the country demanded the reinstallation
of King Charles. The peasants wanted him “because
Sweden was of old a kingdom, not a regent’s land or a
diocese.” King Charles returned in the same year, but
soon left the throne again on account of a conflict with
Bishop Kettil. This latter turned to Christian, promis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>ing
a safe return to the crown if he set free the archbishop.
Christian immediately did so, the worthy bishops
commencing operations against Charles, who, defeated and
forsaken by all, abdicated his throne, January 30, 1465.
The once upon a time richest man of Sweden was now
deprived of all, Christian having taken his hidden treasures.
He retired to Raseborg, a castle in Finland, which
after some hesitation was granted him. “We have,” wrote
he, “in such manner departed from Sweden, that never
longeth us to return thither the third time.” He also complained
of his misery in the following strophe of assonance
verse:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">While I was lord of Fogelwick<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I was both mighty and rich,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But since made the king of Svea land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am a poor and unhappy man.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Great confusion reigned in Sweden during the next two
years. Bishop Kettil, who styled himself regent, tried to
conduct the government in common with the archbishop,
but the great nobles did their own pleasure. At last one
of them, Ivar Axelson Tott, who had the island of Gothland
in fief, joined the party of Charles, marrying his
daughter. His brother, Eric Axelson, was made regent.
Nils Bosson Sture had been repeatedly asked to accept this
dignity, as also the crown, but he refused. He and Sten
Sture, of the original Sture family, who led the army under
Bishop Kettil at Haraker, now made possible the second
reinstallation of Charles, in 1467, the ambitious archbishop
dying in the same year. But Charles was old and weary
of the vanities of life, for which he had made so many sacrifices.
It was only the valor and strength of the two Stures
that made it possible for him to keep the crown and to die<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
in the purple, in 1470. He designated Sten Sture as his
successor at the rudder of state, but warned him not to
seek the crown. “That ambition,” he said, “has crushed
my happiness and cost my life.”</p>

<p>Charles is very sympathetically dealt with in the New
Rhymed, or Charles Chronicle, probably written by one of
his men, who flatters him, as did the Old Chronicle the
ill-fated Duke Eric. Still the Charles Chronicle and its
continuations, the Sture Chronicles, are very important
historic sources of these periods of Unionism versus Patriotism,
from Margaret to Gustavus Vasa. The less reliable
Prose Chronicle and the later historic works by Ericus Olai,
Johannis Magnus and Olaus Petri, also throw light upon
them. What all of these have in common is a fiery
patriotic spirit, entirely lacking in the placid and artistic
lines of the Old Chronicle as compared to the New. With
the seeds of patriotism were sowed those of national hatred
against a foreign foe. That the Dane and not the German
was destined to be this national enemy was disastrous to the
Union of the North, but probably a gain for the cultural
development of Sweden. This period is rich in shorter
poems on political men and conditions, all of a strongly
democratic flavor. Among these the song about his friend
Engelbrekt, by Bishop Thomas of Strengnæs, occupies a
high place, but a still higher one the Song of Liberty, by
the same high-minded patriot.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Unionism versus Patriotism&mdash;Uncrowned Kings of
the Sture Families</i></span></h2>

<p>Sten Sture the Elder was chosen regent by
the council of state and elected by the people
at the Riksdag of Arboga, in 1471. For more than
half a century following upon the reign of Charles VIII.,
Sweden was governed by uncrowned kings, with the intermission
of a few years. These regents had not any republican
ideals in mind, nor were they secretly coveting the
crown. Their ambition was simply to uphold a strong and
firm national government by means of which foreign lordships
could be made impossible, the people enjoy their rights
and their liberty, and the government increase in power and
authority at the expense of Church and nobility. The policy
laid down by Sten Sture the Elder, and strictly adhered to
by him and his successors, was of the broadly democratic
spirit of Engelbrekt. This policy was strengthened by the
high esteem in which the regents were held. Yet their
position was a very difficult one, for although enjoying the
full confidence of the people, they were regarded with envy
and suspicion by the aristocracy, who never could be persuaded
but that these noble uncrowned rulers were secretly
scheming for obtainance of the royal crown.</p>

<p>Sten Sture had the good fortune to inaugurate his reign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
with a glorious victory over King Christian, which put an
end to Danish invasions during a whole generation. Christian
arrived at Stockholm with a fine fleet and a magnificent
army, taking his position at Brunkeberg, close to the north
of the capital. Here a long and fierce battle was fought,
October 10, 1471. Sten Sture commanded a large army of
peasants, attacking Christian’s fortified position from the
north, supported by Knut Posse, with burgher troops, from
the south. At the third attack victory was won, Nils Bosson
Sture arriving on the battle scene with an army of
Dalecarlians. King Christian was wounded in the mouth;
the famous Danish Oriflamme, Dannebrog, was captured,
being surrounded by five hundred corpses of select Danish
knights. Through the prestige of the great victory at
Brunkeberg, Sten Sture managed to give Sweden ten
years of undisturbed peace and comfort. Encouraged by
the victory over the foreign invaders, the city of Stockholm
took the lead in ridding the towns of undue influence,
caused by the supremacy of German commerce. The
town laws held a stipulation that half the number of councillors
in each town council should be Germans. A petition
headed by the burghers of Stockholm and circulated through
the towns was acted upon, the council of state abolishing
by law the stipulation in question. Free markets were established
in the commercial centres Kalmar and Sœderkœping,
and a new commercial town was founded on the Gotha
River, to be called Gothahamn, although the name was
changed to New Lœdœse. In spite of the supremacy of
the Hanseatic League, commerce was good, the iron mines
of Dalecarlia, Westmanland, Nerike and Eastern Vermland
growing in importance, and silver being produced by various
mines in Dalecarlia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Sten gave careful and loving attention to the needs
of the yeomanry and the common people. He kept an open
and watchful eye on the bailiffs, and carried out the demands
of justice with severity. Many farms, desolate and
neglected during the times of war, were brought under cultivation.
Lord Sten made no decision in any matter of importance
without consulting the yeomen and the burghers,
as well as the nobles, at <i>Riksdagar</i>, the parliamentary nature
of which was further developed. With a firm hand he
held the nobles down to order and the requirements of a
national democratic policy. The powerful brothers Ivar
and Eric Tott especially caused him annoyance, the former
holding the island of Gothland, the latter the duchy of Finland,
in fief. It came to open hostilities with Ivar Tott
who, defeated and deprived of his castles, fled to Denmark,
taking revenge by turning the much contested island over
to said power.</p>

<p>Lord Sten was a very pious man, but he held the
ecclesiastics under strict surveillance on account of their
unpatriotic tendencies. But he collaborated with them
for the establishment of a state university at Upsala, in
which the archbishop, Jacob Ulfsson, was greatly interested.
Sanctioned by the pope, the university was opened
in 1477, with great ceremonies. One of its earliest professors
was Ericus Olai, the author of the first but rather uncritical
work of Swedish history, Chronica Regni Gothorum,
written in awkward mediæval Latin, but in a style attractive
through its vivacity. Latin was chiefly used by
the learned and literary men. The cloisters and the cathedrals
had schools where the young people were trained for
the learned professions, chiefly the Church. For a university
education, the institutions of Cologne, Prague, Leipzig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
and Bologna, but chiefly Paris, the greatest of them all, had
been sought. The Swedes had three <i>collegia</i> in Paris, and
the Scandinavians held there an honored position as scholars,
the Swedes three times filling the office of rector
or president of the Paris university, the highest dignity of
learning in the world. Ingeborg Tott, the wife of Sten Sture,
was a great friend of learning, having books printed at her
expense and collecting a large library in the convent of
Mariefred, founded by Lord Sten.</p>

<p>The peace of the country was disturbed by a war with
Russia. Attacks on the castle of Viborg had been made
shortly after the battle of Brunkeberg, but warded off by
Eric Tott, who in return invaded Russian territory. After
his death the valiant Knut Posse was made commander of
Viborg. The Russians, in 1495, made a violent attack upon
the castle, damaging it considerably. But Posse led the
defence with superior skill, repulsing the enemy with astounding
force. This deed has become famous in popular
traditions, both Swedes and Russians crediting Posse with
an alliance of a supernatural order. The regent himself
twice headed expeditions to Finland, forcing a new Russian
army to retire over the frontier. Affairs were going
badly on account of unsafety in Finland, and dearth and
intrigues in Sweden. The council of state accused Lord
Sten of not doing all he could for Finland while secretly
fanning the discontent of the commanders, who made personal
sacrifices of time and money by remaining with the
army. It came to hot words between Lord Sten and
the commander Svante Sture, the son of Nils Bosson. He
returned home, although Lord Sten told him he was a
deserter in so doing, “fleeing from the banner of state.”
Svante Sture, who with Posse had made a glorious inroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
upon Russian territory, now joined the aristocratic enemies
of the regent, calling in King John (Hans) of Denmark.
John succeeded Christian in 1482, and commenced intriguing
for the Swedish crown. The Swedish nobles were anxious
to have this good-natured monarch for ruler. Lord
Sten was too sagacious to openly oppose them, when they,
in the so-called <i>Recess of Kalmar</i> of 1483, declared <i>John</i>
king of Sweden, the king promising the island of Gothland
to Sweden, and all old privileges to the nobles. By means
of skilful diplomatic operations, Lord Sten delayed matters
to such an extent that it took fourteen years before John II.
was king of Sweden in anything but name. But the time
was ripe for Svante Sture’s open conflict with Lord Sten.
The council, the archbishop leading, broke their faith with
the regent, offering King John the crown. He came with
an army to Stockholm, taking his position at Brunkeberg.
An army of Dalecarlians marched upon the capital at the
solicitation of Lord Sten, who awaited them with another
army. The operations took an unfavorable turn on account
of misapprehended movements, Lord Sten with difficulty
saving his life. King John understood that a continued
struggle would lead to his ultimate defeat and made peace.
Lord Sten retired, but with the greatest fiefs given to any
Swedish man; viz., the whole of Finland, with large possessions
besides. When the king entered Stockholm, in
October, 1497, it was at the arm of Lord Sten, to whom
he said jestingly: “Have you now prepared everything well
for me at the castle, Lord Sten; the table set with meat and
ale, so that my guests may make merry?” Lord Sten answered
in the same light spirit, pointing to the Swedish
nobles who had joined the royal retinue: “That these know
best who stand there behind you. They have it all both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
baked and brewed.” Later the king remarked: “Lord
Sten, it is a bad inheritance you have bequeathed on me
in Sweden; the peasants whom God created slaves you have
made into lords, and those who should have been lords you
try to make slaves.” At his coronation in Upsala, the king
bestowed knighthood upon many Swedish nobles (something
that had been beyond Lord Sten’s authority to do),
upon his return to Denmark appointing Lord Sten to take
the reins of government with three state councillors at his
side.</p>

<p>King John’s reign in Sweden was of short duration.
He failed to return the island of Gothland to the Swedish
crown and lost his prestige through an unsuccessful war in
Ditmarschen. Svante Sture, who had not been dealt with
according to his expectations, declared war upon the king
and joined Lord Sten, who was in an unenviable position
and glad to shake off the Union with Denmark, which he
did, in 1501, when made regent for the second time. With
a peasant army siege was laid to the castle of Stockholm,
held by the energetic Queen Christine, who capitulated after
a heroic struggle. Three days later King John appeared
with an army, but returned, seeing that he came too late.
Lord Sten retained Queen Christine at Vadstena for some
time, later escorting her to the Danish frontier. Upon his
return he was taken ill and died suddenly at Jœnkœping,
December 14, 1503. With him the older or original line
of the Sture family became extinct. Lord Sten was the
greatest ruler since Margaret, and his rule, being of a more
patriotic and democratic tendency, was of greater benefit
to Sweden than hers.</p>

<p><i>Svante Sture</i> succeeded Sten. He was of the younger
Sture line, the son of the noble patriot, Nils Bosson, who in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
the time of Charles VIII., as the friend of Engelbrekt and
Bishop Thomas, had taken stand against the archbishop
and the nobles, backed by the Dalecarlians, who adored
him. Lord Svante was a very quick-tempered man, which
led him into the conflict with Lord Sten. Unlike the regent
and his own father, he never had experienced what Danish
oppression meant, which accounts for his unwise decision in
joining the Unionists. The war with Denmark lasted eight
of his nine years of reign, which proves him an able soldier
and a stanch patriot. His position from the start was less
favorable than that of his predecessor, who could reign in
the glory of his early victory at Brunkeberg.</p>

<p>Lord Svante had in <i>Doctor Hemming Gad</i> a patriotic
adviser of rare attainments and great learning. He had
studied in Rostock, was for twelve years Lord Sten’s representative
in Italy, and later bishop of Linkœping, although
never sanctioned and finally placed under ban by
the pope. Hemming Gad was the first democratic agitator
of Sweden, a warm admirer of the Stures, and a good soldier.
His statecraft he had evidently learned in Italy with
her traditions of Machiavelli. His literary style is very
characteristic, the language of a learned ecclesiastic with
the oaths of a soldier. Those of his writings which are still
extant prove a great love for the common people, a love
which was returned by them. Having organized the revolt
against King John, he evinced great slyness and presence
of mind at the death of Lord Sten. To preserve its secrecy
until Svante was forewarned and in possession of the castle
of Stockholm, he had a man dress in the clothes of the deceased
regent and continue the journey to the capital with
Sten’s retinue.</p>

<p>The Unionist party was as ready as ever to offer the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
crown to King John, their representatives agreeing to pay
a yearly tribute until he or his son Christian was chosen
king. This agreement was made in 1509, but it called forth
a storm of indignation from the patriots and the people, and
was never considered by the government. Lubeck opened
hostilities against Denmark and was joined by Sweden, the
Unionists recommencing deliberations whenever it looked favorable
for Danish interests. Lord Svante made sure of peace
and safety for Finland before taking up the conflict with the
Danes. On the eastern shore, Hemming Gad led the operations
against the town and castle of Kalmar, held by the
Danes. The town was soon captured, but the castle not
before the end of 1510. Ake Hansson (Natt och Dag)
fought with great valor and considerable success against
the Danes on the western and southern frontier, until this
“Tormentor of Denmark,” as he was surnamed, was killed
in battle in 1510. On the sea the Danes were superior, a
fleet under the command of Otto Rud and Soren Norrby
plundering Abo in Finland. But when Lubeck’s fleet
appeared the Danes were forced back. Peace was made,
but soon broken. Lubeck sent a fleet to invade the coast
of the Danish isles; Hemming Gad, with several Swedish
ships, taking part in the expedition. Denmark did her best
to crush Swedish resistance by inducing Russia to break the
peace, the emperor to declare Sweden the arch enemy of
the German empire, and the pope to place her under ban.</p>

<p>More unfortunate to Sweden than these intrigues was
the fact that King John in his son Christian had an able
warrior and a great organizer. Prince Christian put down
a revolt in Norway against Danish oppression, entering
West Gothland with a superior army. The Unionists
assembled to force the regent to abdicate, but he firmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
refused to do so. A rebellion seemed imminent, Lord
Svante hastening to Westeros to confer with the people
of the mining districts. Shortly after the opening of the
meeting, Lord Svante died quite suddenly, after a stroke
of paralysis, in January, 1512.</p>

<p>The council of state selected Eric Trolle, a learned but
unfit man of the Unionists, to succeed Lord Svante. But
the popular opinion condemned him, and the council was
forced to choose Svante’s son as his successor.</p>

<p><i>Sten Sture the Younger</i> was barely nineteen years of
age at his father’s death. Knighted when only five, he
early distinguished himself as a warrior, winning fame
for his chivalric spirit and noble character, and, like his
illustrious namesakes, his father and grandfather, becoming
the idol of the people. And he deserved their idolatry.
More resembling his grandfather in the sweetness of his
disposition than his sterner predecessors, he was as great
a warrior as his father, to which he joined the sagacity
and power of self-control characteristic of the elder Lord
Sten. As a youth, he was made regent of a country in
war, distress and peril. He was called away by death
when only twenty-seven, leaving behind the memory of
not one evil deed to soil the glory of his fair name, although
continually placed in trying and dangerous positions
of strife, rivalry, envy and rebellion. He made his
will respected by high and low with a temperance in spirit
and methods worthy of the highest admiration and the
devoted love of the people. The young Lord Sten had a
tender heart for the lowly and the suffering, never fearing
to wring their rights from the oppressors, whosoever they
were. He took great interest in the pursuits of peace, during
the intervals allowed by his successful exploits in war.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
In spite of the plague and other contagious diseases, which,
together with the destruction of war, ravaged the country,
he left it in a better condition than he received it. In
many ways more farseeing than his contemporaries, his
name will live on for centuries as one of the most beloved
in Swedish history.</p>

<p>With the younger Lord Sten, other new actors appeared
upon the stage of Scandinavian history. Christian II. succeeded
his father upon the throne of Denmark and Norway.
In Sweden, Archbishop Jacob Ulfsson retired and was
succeeded by Gustavus Trolle, a son of Lord Eric. The
new archbishop was of a hateful and jealous disposition.
He resolved to avenge the treatment his father had received
at the hands of Lord Sten and the Swedish people by placing
Christian on the throne. The young regent made no
less than four attempts to win over this formidable enemy,
but all in vain. He opened up a court at Stæket, in Upland,
more brilliant than that of Lord Sten, and accepted
subsidies from Denmark. At last, fully aware of the secret
deliberations going on, Lord Sten surrounded Stæket and
called a Riksdag at Arboga, in 1517, where it was resolved
that Christian should never become king of Sweden, and
that the siege of Stæket should be continued. Christian
sent a little army to support his ally, but Lord Sten met
it at Ladugardsland, outside of Stockholm, completely routing
it. A new Riksdag was called at Stockholm before
which the archbishop appeared upon truce. His language
was haughty and disdainful. He said he was in his full
right to support King Christian’s claims with mitre and
sword, the pope sanctioning his policy; and to the pope
alone he was responsible. The indignant Riksdag resolved
that the archbishop should be deprived of his seat, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
guilty of high treason, and that his castle should be burned.
The resolution was written down and signed by all the bishops,
none daring to oppose the yeomanry. Bishop Brask,
of Linkœping, managed to conceal in the wax of his seal
a paper with the words: “To this I am forced by necessity.”
The archbishop returned to defend Stæket, but soon
had to flee with his followers. It was only by using all his
authority that Lord Sten could save his enemy’s life from
the irate people. Trolle was forced to resign his seat and
was imprisoned in a convent at Westeros, while his castle
was torn down. Lord Sten wanted to appoint a successor
to Trolle, but Bishop Brask objected that the pope might
not consent to his removal. To this Lord Sten uttered the
following manly words, hardly in touch with the policy of
Rome: “I think that our most holy father, the pope, and
the canonic law should not tolerate as the leaders of the
Church, and as the precepts or mirrors to the people, men
who are infested by open treason, in particular against their
own country.” The Church tried various means to gain
a settled condition of things. When Sten refused the royal
crown from its hand, he was at last placed under ban.</p>

<p>The hostilities with Denmark recommenced. King
Christian appeared with a fleet and an army, in June,
1518, laying siege to Stockholm. His attacks were valiantly
repulsed, and Christian, fearing to be encircled by
his enemies, marched away in a southeasterly direction,
taking a firm position at Brennkyrka. A Swedish army
met him from the south and gave battle one of the
last days of July, 1518. It was a fierce conflict, ending
with a victory for the Swedes. The chief banner was carried
by the squire Gustavus Ericsson Vasa, who five years
later was to become king of Sweden. Christian returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
to attack Stockholm, once more in vain. He was to sail
for Denmark, but was kept back by storms, great suffering
being experienced by his men. Christian was forced to
open deliberations, making very high demands. But Lord
Sten refused to hold a meeting, postponing it to the following
year. A few days later, King Christian sent word that
he wanted the regent to visit him in his ship on important
affairs. Lord Sten, always good-natured and ready to
accept peace, thought that the king had changed his mind
and was ready to go. But the burgomaster and council
of Stockholm prevailed upon him not to go, sure that it
would bring him into the enemy’s hands. Lord Sten took
their advice and arranged for a meeting on land, sending
six Swedish nobles as hostages to the king at his demand.
Among these were Dr. Hemming Gad and Gustavus Ericsson
Vasa. For two days Lord Sten waited in vain for the
king to appear. Then he learned, to his dismay and indignation,
that King Christian had sailed to Denmark, taking
the hostages with him as prisoners, October 4, 1518.</p>

<p>Christian collected all his forces and resources to crush
Sweden. The whole of the following year was spent in
preparations. Sweden was placed under ban by the pope,
and Christian made himself his representative, the one who
was to fulfil the heavenly punishment. In January, 1520,
a large Danish army invaded Smaland and West Gothland.
Lord Sten made an appeal to the people and gathered a
peasant army, with which he met the superior force of the
enemy at Bogesund, in West Gothland. The Swedish
forces were arranged in line on the frozen surface of Lake
Asund. Lord Sten rode in front of the line, encouraging
his men, but was seriously wounded during the very first
engagement and carried from the field. After two vain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
attempts, the Danes were victorious in overthrowing the
Swedes. These gathered in the wooded hills of Tiveden
for a last heroic resistance, which was broken; the Danes
taking possession of the provinces to the north. Lord Sten,
mortally wounded, died on the ice of Lake Mælar during
his journey to Stockholm. Christian continued his march
on Stockholm, the castle of which was heroically defended
by Lord Sten’s consort, Christine Gyllenstierna, who also
tried by support and exhortations to encourage other strongholds
not yet surrendered to resist the Danes. The castle
of Kalmar was defended by another heroic woman, Anna
Bielke. But Christian won, through persuasions and deliberations,
what he could not take by violence. His operations
were carried on by Dr. Hemming Gad, who, for reasons
unknown to history, had changed his old patriotic
views and become a friend of Christian. In September,
1520, Christian won Stockholm by peaceful agreement.
The 4th of November he was crowned by Trolle, the reinstalled
archbishop. At this occasion it caused considerable
surprise that only Danes and Germans were knighted, the
herald proclaiming that the country was won by sword, for
which reason no Swede could be thus honored. This was
in striking contrast to Christian’s proclamation of having
ascended the throne by right of his descent from St. Eric.
Worse things were to follow.</p>

<p>The 7th of November a great number of Swedish nobles
were called to the castle of Stockholm, where they were
brought before a tribunal, the king presiding. The archbishop
asked for remuneration for the sufferings caused him
during Lord Sten’s reign. A jury of bishops and nobles
convened. Christine Gyllenstierna was the first to answer
to the accusations, holding forth that the Riksdag of Ar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>boga
was responsible for the action taken against Trolle
and bringing the signed document in evidence. The king
answered by announcing that all who signed were under the
ban of the pope; Bishop Brask was the only one acquitted,
producing his written slip of reservation from under his
seal, besides Bishop Otto of Westerns, who supported Trolle
in his claims. In the evening all the accused were imprisoned
and judgment passed on them the following morning.</p>

<p>In the morning of November 8th, a solemn procession
of convicts started from the castle to the grand square,
hedged in by soldiers and executioners. The bishops Mattias
of Strengnæs and Vincentius of Skara, in their ecclesiastical
robes, came first, followed by thirteen noblemen and thirty-one
town councillors and burghers of Stockholm. In the
square, a Danish councillor of state from the porch of the
court-house asked the masses not to be frightened. The
archbishop, he said, had three times on his knees implored
the king that justice should be done. Bishop Vincentius
replied with great courage that the king had committed
treason against the Swedes and called down divine punishment
on him for such deeds. Two of the Swedish nobles
followed the bishop with short addresses, admonishing the
people not to believe in false letters and promises and to put
down such tyranny as soon as within their power. King
Christian, who from a window of a house facing the square
looked down on the spectacle, now gave a sign for the
executions to commence. First the bishops, then the state
councillors, nobles and burghers were beheaded, among
whom were two brothers of Christine Gyllenstierna and
the father and brother-in-law of Gustavus Ericsson Vasa.
Many burghers were captured in the street, or in their
homes, and brought in to be executed, others being killed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
on the spot. Not less than eighty-two persons were that
day executed, the number being increased during the following
days by people killed in various ways. Olaus Petri,
the reformer, who was an eyewitness, in his history gives
a graphic description of the terrible scenes. He adds:
“Yes, this was a horrible and cruel murder, such as no
other prince who carried a Christian name ever committed
before.” The corpses were burned, the remains of Lord
Sten and one of his sons being taken from their graves and
thrown into the flames. Christine Gyllenstierna, and the
mother and sister of Gustavus Vasa, were with several
other ladies carried to Copenhagen and thrown into a miserable
dungeon. The mass murder has been called the Carnage
of Stockholm, but it was extended also to Finland&mdash;where
Dr. Hemming Gad was executed at Raseborg&mdash;and
to the provinces. Christian marked his return through the
Swedish mainland to Copenhagen by executions and mass
murder everywhere; six hundred are estimated to have been
killed through his order during his short stay in Sweden.</p>

<p>Archbishop Trolle had taken a terrible revenge, and
Christian thought he had crushed forever the stubborn
Swedish resistance. But through this excess of cruelty the
Union became insupportable, and the Swedish people resolved
to throw off forever the connection with any foreign
ruler. In the woods of Dalecarlia a man was hiding who
soon was to step forward to lead the work of liberation and
independence.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Revolution and Reformation&mdash;Gustavus Vasa</i></span></h2>

<p>Gustavus Ericsson Vasa, the man whom
Providence had selected to save his country from
anarchy and ruin, belonged to a noble family of
Unionist sympathies, his great-grandfather being Drotsete
Krister Nilsson Vasa. But the Vasa family had joined
the cause of the patriots during the reigns of the Stures,
simultaneously losing some of its earlier importance. The
Vasas prided themselves on being the descendants of St.
Eric and his line, and of St. Birgitta and the Folkungs.
Its coat-of-arms consisted of a simple vase, or bundle of
sticks. Gustavus Vasa was born May 12, 1496, at Lindholmen
in Upland, at the mansion of his parents, Eric
Johansson Vasa, state councillor, and Cecilia of Eka, a
sister of Christine Gyllenstierna. His earliest years were
spent with his mother at Rydboholm, another estate of his
father’s, beautifully situated on an arm of the Baltic, only
ten miles north of Stockholm. When a mere boy he was
sent to the court of his granduncle, Sten Sture the Elder,
who was childless. King John of Denmark noticed the
bright little boy during a visit paid to Lord Sten. Young
Gustavus took the command of all the other children at
play and appeared to be a born leader. The king called the
boy to him and asked him what his name was. Gustavus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
answered frankly. King John smilingly placed his hand
on the boy’s head, saying: “Certainly thou shalt become
a man in thy day if preserved in life.” The king intimated
that he wanted to take him along to Copenhagen to
supervise his education. But Lord Sten, who did not like
this idea, hurriedly had Gustavus sent away, so that he
could tell the king upon a second inquiry that the boy had
returned to his parents. The young Gustavus was described
as “attractive and welcome with everybody.”
Gustavus was sent to Upsala to study at the age of thirteen.
The University of Upsala was at that period in a
state of stagnation. The first teacher who came in contact
with Gustavus was a Dane named Master Ivar. According
to the Prose Chronicle, he was a man who “was mean
to everybody and who gave Gustavo drubbings.” It seems
that the patriotic spirit early woke in the breast of this
youth, who already in these days foreshadowed his own
mission in the following words: “I will betake myself to
Dalecarlia, rouse the Dalecarlians and batter the nose of the
Jute.” When eighteen years of age, he was accepted as a
squire at the court of Sten Sture the Younger, and Christine
Gyllenstierna, his own aunt. He followed the younger
Lord Sten in all his expeditions of war, taking part in the
siege of Stæket and a battle of Dufnæs, and carrying
the banner of state at Brennkyrka.</p>

<p>A second time in his life it came to pass that Gustavus
Vasa was considered a person whom the Danish king was
desirious of carrying away. This time the king was Christian
II., who gained his object by treachery and violence.
Gustavus was one of the Swedish hostages who were offered
to King Christian and by him carried away to Denmark.</p>

<p>Gustavus was handed over to Eric Banér, a relative of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
his, who held in fief the castle of Kallœ in Jutland. The
latter was placed under a heavy fine in case he allowed his
prisoner to escape. Gustavus received a kind and generous
treatment. He ate at the table of the lord and was allowed
to wander at liberty in the close neighborhood of the castle.
But the danger that menaced his country never left him
in peace. He heard repeatedly of the great preparations
made by Christian II. to crush the resistance of Sweden,
and of the acts of violence to be perpetrated. Gustavus
remained at Kallœ for a year, when he resolved to flee
from a captivity which had become insupportable. One
morning at sunrise, Gustavus Vasa put on the garb of a
peasant and disappeared from the castle. He made good
speed, reaching a seaport and escaping to Lubeck with a
merchant vessel. In this friendly Hanseatic centre Gustavus
expected armed support. Such was not granted, but
he was shielded against Danish pursuit. Eric Banér arrived,
having followed up his tracks, but his demands to
have Gustavus surrendered were refused. After eight
months of delay in Lubeck, Gustavus obtained leave and
arrived in Sweden on board a German ship. He landed
at Stensœ, a promontory outside of the town of Kalmar,
while Christian II. was laying siege to Stockholm. Gustavus
was resolved to do his utmost to rouse the people
to active resistance against the invaders. The castle of
Kalmar, next to that of Stockholm the firmest stronghold
of Sweden, was in charge of Anna Bielke, the widow of
the last commander. Gustavus strengthened the courage
of the inhabitants of town and castle, but finding it impossible
to accomplish anything for the defence himself, and
unsuccessful in his attempts to bring the hired German
troops up to a point of enthusiasm for the Swedish cause,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
he left Kalmar and continued his way through Smaland.
But the population of this province had no patience to listen
to his appeals for a revolt. The peasants answered him
that if they remained faithful to the Danish king they were
never to be in want of herring and salt. Some of them in
their indignation sent arrows flying after the young patriot.
In September he reached the Terna estate in Sœdermanland,
where his sister and her husband, Joachim Brahe,
resided. Lord Joachim had just received an invitation
to be present at the coronation of King Christian in Stockholm.
The attempts made by Gustavus to persuade the
couple to abandon their intended journey to Stockholm were
futile. Reaching his paternal estate of Ræfsnæs in Sœdermanland,
he remained there in concealment for some time.
He visited the old archbishop Jacob Ulfsson, who, after his
retirement, lived in the neighboring monastery of Mariefred.
The old prelate tried his best to persuade him to seek
mercy and grace of King Christian, but the resolution of
the young squire to free his country was only strengthened
into an iron-cast determination. One of the servants who
had followed Lord Joachim to the capital managed to make
a safe return to tell Gustavus the terrible news of the Carnage
of Stockholm. He was also told that a high price had
been placed on his own head.</p>

<p>Gustavus at once prepared for flight. Accompanied by
a single servant he secretly left Ræfsnæs one day toward
the end of November, travelling on horseback northward to
Dalecarlia. He arrived at Kopparberg in Dalecarlia, where
he had his hair close cropped and put on peasant’s clothes.
Putting an axe over his shoulder, he went about looking for
employment. The first man whom he tried was Andrew
Persson, a wealthy mine owner at Rankhytta. Gustavus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
found employment with him, taking part in the threshing.
But the other servants soon detected that the new man had
a carriage and habits different from their own, and they
commenced to watch him closely. They noticed that he
was not accustomed to the work, and one of the servant
girls saw a collar of silk above the coarse blouse. Andrew
Persson called before him the suspect, and was highly surprised
when recognizing in him a comrade from the time
of his student days at Upsala. He was favorably disposed,
but was afraid of sheltering Gustavus, advising him to flee
to the less thickly settled parts of the province, and to
change often from one place to another. Gustavus continued
his way in a westerly direction, following the shore
of a lake named Runn, and arrived at Ornæs the following
day. He knew he had an old comrade and friend in the
owner of the place. This man, Arendt Persson, received
him in the most hospitable manner, but was in his heart
desirous of obtaining the price placed upon the head of the
young squire. Gustavus went to bed in the attic, not suspecting
treachery. The host himself accompanied him to
his resting place, according to the mediæval custom. This
done, Arendt travelled in great haste to one of his neighbors,
the much-respected Mons Nilsson of Aspeboda.
Arendt asked him to assist in capturing Gustavus Vasa;
but Mons Nilsson flatly refused, taking no pains to hide
his indignation. Arendt left and went past his own home
to Sætra, which was the residence of the Danish bailiff.
He started for Ornæs the following morning, accompanied
by the bailiff and twenty men ready to capture the fugitive.
But Arendt’s wife, Lady Barbro Stigsdotter (Swinhufwud),
had not been inactive. Her suspicion was aroused when she
noticed her husband travelling back and forth to disappear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
in the direction where the bailiff resided. She divined that
the safety of her guest was threatened and decided to take
action. Lady Barbro went to the attic, roused her sleeping
guest and told him of the impending danger. Gustavus let
himself down to the ground by means of towels fastened to
the window-sill, assisted by Lady Barbro, who had a horse
and sleigh in readiness for him, in charge of a faithful
servant. He reached the residence of John, the priest of
Sværdsjœ. Arendt was enraged when he found that Gustavus
had made his escape. It is said that he from that
day refused to ever see Lady Barbro again.</p>

<p>The priest of Sværdsjœ held Gustavus in concealment
for three days, but advised him to seek a more secure hiding
place. He sent Gustavus to Swan Elfsson, a hunter to
the king, who dwelt in Isala, a short distance from the
church of Sværdsjœ. Gustavus had hardly reached this
place before the men sent after him by the bailiff arrived.
Gustavus stood by the oven warming himself after the ride.
The wife of Swan Elfsson was busy baking bread. The
men entered, asking if any stranger had been noticed in the
neighborhood. The woman of the house saved the situation
by resolutely dealing a blow with the bread spade to Gustavus,
who was turning his back to her. In an irritated
voice she said: “Why dost thou stand here gaping at the
strangers? Hast thou never seen people before? Get thee
at once out to the barn and do some threshing.” The men
did not suspect in the snubbed servant the noble fugitive for
whom they were looking. But Swan Elfsson was not sure
of the safety of his guest if he remained in Isala. So he
concealed Gustavus in a load of hay and left his house with
the great unsettled districts as his destination. He met
some Danish spies on the way. These suspected the peas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>ant
and pierced the load of hay with their lances repeatedly.
Gustavus was wounded in the leg, but kept his breath and
lay perfectly still. The spies were satisfied that everything
was right and told Swan Elfsson to move on. But the
peasant noticed that blood was dripping from his load, leaving
scarlet tracks on the snow. He quickly drew his knife
and cut his horse a deep wound in one foot. After a while
the spies noticed the bloody tracks. They returned and
commanded Swan Elfsson to halt, inquiring about the
blood. Swan Elfsson pointed to the injured foot of his
horse and succeeded in making them believe that the horse
had met with an accident.</p>

<p>Swan Elfsson left Gustavus at the village of Marnæs,
situated in the Finn woods, where he was received by other
hunters. These escorted the noble outlaw to a place further
away in the woods, where he for three days remained in
concealment under a big fallen fir tree. The peasants
in the neighborhood brought food to him. The still hunt
seemed to be at an end, and so Gustavus risked a visit to
the church of Rettvik, situated on the eastern shore of Lake
Siljan. He spoke to the yeomanry collected around the
church after divine service, reminding them of the stanch
patriotism and manliness of their ancestors, and imploring
them to save their country from destruction. The yeomen
of Rettvik gave a satisfactory answer, telling him that they
were ready to resist the Danes. But as they had not heard
the opinion of the people of the other parishes, there was
nothing to be done for the moment.</p>

<p>Gustavus continued his way to Mora, one of the most
densely populated parishes of Dalecarlia and situated on the
northern shore of Lake Siljan. The priest of the parish
was afraid to hide the outlaw, but confided him to a peas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>ant,
Tomte Mats, in the village of Utmeland. Gustavus
remained for several days concealed in a vaulted cellar,
which was reached only through a hole in the floor of the
cottage above. One day the bailiff’s men entered to search
for Gustavus. The woman of the house was busy brewing
the Christmas ale. She saved Gustavus by quickly placing
a big barrel over the hinged door, which covered the opening
to the cellar. One of the holidays during Christmas
Gustavus addressed the peasants of Mora when coming
from church. He stood on a small hill near the churchyard.
The noonday sun was shining brightly over the
snowy landscape and a fresh northerly wind was blowing.
Gustavus spoke in a loud voice and with great eloquence.
He asked the men to reflect on what kind of government
foreigners always had given Sweden, and to remember what
they had themselves suffered and risked for the liberty of
their country. He thought that the memory had not died
either of the deeds of violence perpetrated by Jœsse Ericsson
or of the deeds of heroism done by Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson.
He then told them of the treacherous villany
of King Christian and of the Carnage of Stockholm. “My
own father,” he said, with tears in his eyes, “rather wished
to die with his brethren, the honest lords, in the name of
God, than to be spared and live in dishonor after them.”
If the Dalecarlians wanted to save Sweden from thraldom,
he was ready to offer himself as their leader in the name of
the Almighty. The speech of Gustavus made a deep impression
upon the men of Mora, and some of them were
anxious to rise at once. The majority ruled, deciding that
no action should be taken before the other parishes of Dalecarlia
had been heard from. They advised Gustavus to
seek a safer hiding-place further up in the woods. Gus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>tavus
left Mora utterly discouraged, seeking the paths that
led along the Dal River into desert wilds.</p>

<p>At New Year of 1521 Lars Olsson, a soldier who had
done good service in the times of the Stures, arrived at
Mora, bringing particulars of the doings of King Christian.
He told the peasants that the king had ordered gallows to
be erected at every sheriff’s residence to mark the way of
his Eriksgata. The peasants were touched to the quick and
regretted having sent away the young nobleman. Lars
Olsson advised them to call him back. Two expert ski
runners were sent after Gustavus Ericsson, and after a
ride of a night and a day through the woods, they overtook
him close by the Norwegian frontier, which he was ready
to cross in despair.</p>

<p>Gustavus returned to Mora and was made the leader
of the peasants in that locality. With these men he started
his work of liberation, which was the commencement of one
of the most remarkable of revolutions that the world ever
saw. In the beginning of February, 1521, Gustavus
marched southward with a few hundred men. At Falun
he captured the bailiff of the mines, confiscating the royal
taxes. Returning to the starting point, he left it again,
with an army of 1,500 men. Entering Norrland, where
he was joined by the peasants of Gestrikland, and the
burghers of Gefle, while the people of Helsingland asked
for time to consider the matter, he learned upon his return
how one of his commanders, Peder Swensson, had won a
glorious victory over a Danish army 6,000 strong at the
ferry of Brunnbæck, by the Dal River. Gustavus began
training his troops, enforcing severe discipline and providing
them with better arrows and longer lances. He declared
war upon Christian in a formal way and marched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
on Westeros, where the Danish troops had centred. The
town and castle were captured in spite of a force of superior
Danish cavalry.</p>

<p>Gustavus shifted his army into divisions which marched
in various directions to capture the castles of surrounding
provinces. The people of Upland reinforced the Dalecarlians,
who were sent home to tend to their sowing. The
Upland forces captured the archbishop’s seat during his absence,
and were joined by Gustavus at Upsala, who made an
exceedingly severe speech to the ecclesiastics, asking them
to decide their nationality, whether they were Swedes or
not. They asked permission to consult Archbishop Trolle,
which was granted. “I will bring the reply myself,” said
Trolle, starting from Stockholm with a splendid body of
German troops. Gustavus was near being taken by surprise,
but gathering troops he fought the archbishop, whose
force met with a crushing defeat, and he escaped with
difficulty to Stockholm.</p>

<p>At midsummer, 1521, Gustavus arrived at Brunkeberg,
laying siege to Stockholm. The capital was strongly fortified,
and Norrby with a Danish fleet supported and relieved
it. Twice the Danes routed the Swedish troops with the
intermission of one year, but Gustavus provided reinforcements.
He travelled through the country, visiting the
forces who laid siege to the various Danish strongholds, these
surrendering one by one. It was not a chain of glorious
exploits, this work which Gustavus carried to a successful
end, but one of infinite patience and sagacity, saddened by
the news that the revengeful Christian had ended the lives
of his captive mother and sister in the miserable Danish
dungeon. Bishop Brask was scared into submission, turning
his castle Stegeborg and part of his troops over to Gus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>tavus,
who at a Riksdag at Vadstena was elected regent
in August, 1521.</p>

<p>Gustavus entered into an alliance with Lubeck, and
it sent a fleet to Stockholm, thus encircling it also from the
sea. Norrby left with his ships and was nearly caught in
the ice in the following spring. In Denmark, Christian’s
reign came to an end. With his usual violence he attacked
the nobles and the ecclesiastics in order to better the conditions
of the peasants, for whom he had a tender sympathy.
In so doing, he brought the nobles to open revolt against
his rule. He left his throne in April, 1523. Now Gustavus
found the opportune moment to accept the Swedish crown
offered him. He called a Riksdag at Strengnæs, in June,
1523, where Gustavus was chosen king of Sweden “by the
councillors of state with the consent of the common people.”
At this occasion a tax was agreed on to pay the German
troops engaged in the siege of Stockholm, and to Lubeck
for its timely support. In that very month Stockholm surrendered,
and Gustavus held his proud entry into the capital
on the eve of Midsummer day.</p>

<p>The position of the king was a most difficult one. The
crown was ruined through the previous state of anarchy
and the expense of war. The Church was in undisturbed
possession of its wealth, but not willing to yield any of its
power or income. Christian was preparing a plan by which
to recapture his lost crowns. Norrby, who had aspirations
of becoming Christian’s regent in Sweden, tried to persuade
Christine Gyllenstierna, lately set free from her prison, to
marry him in order to obtain the prestige of the Stures.
The common people, whom Gustavus so recently used to
free the country, grew restive and rebellious when he could
not at once grant them guarantees of comfort and prosperity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
in return. In a marvellous manner Gustavus understood
how to face the situation and how to use to the utmost
the resources within reach.</p>

<p>When the outlawed youth of twenty-four spoke of revolt
to the peasants at Mora, Martin Luther was burning the
ban placed on him by the pope. There were several warm
friends of Luther in Sweden, principally Olaus Petri, himself
a pupil and friend of the German reformer, his brother,
Laurentius Petri, and Laurentius Andreæ. Olaus was a
soul of fire and enthusiasm. He was lacking in self-control,
but possessed a power which if not restrained would
have led him and his work of reform further than the goal
set by Luther. The two Laurentii were, like him, men of
learning and, in addition, of greater sagacity. The king
took interest in these men. He was contemplating a reduction
of the ecclesiastical power, and they were to prepare
the soil by freeing the people from undue respect for the
Roman Church and its worldly power. Laurentius Andreæ
was made the king’s chancellor, and Olaus Petri secretary
to the town council of Stockholm, later pastor of the Cathedral
Church. Olaus preached in the Stockholm Cathedral
fiery sermons against Rome and the pope, responded to
sometimes by irate monks, sometimes by various projectiles
from the audience. Gustavus took pains to fill the
vacancies of the Church, which were many, by appointing
able men. But he made two serious mistakes in making
Master Knut, dean of Westeros, archbishop, and Peder
Sunnanvæder, formerly secretary to Svante Sture, bishop
of Westeros. He came in possession of a correspondence,
which proved that Bishop Peder tried to bring the Dalecarlians
to revolt, and when accusing him and finding Master
Knut on the side of the defence, Gustavus deprived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
them of their new dignities. The king commanded that
a new bishop should be appointed and himself selected
Johannes Magni as archbishop. This prelate, a very
learned man, was the representative of Sten Sture in
Rome, returning to his native land as a papal legate.
Gustavus had a rupture with him when, according to his
instructions, he demanded that Trolle should be reinstated
as archbishop. Archbishop Johannes was lacking in moral
courage; brushed aside by the tide of Reformation, he retired
to Rome, where he died after writing the history of
Sweden in Latin, <i>Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus</i>.
Master Knut and Peder Sunnanvæder turned their steps to
Dalecarlia, fanning the brewing malcontent and opening
connections with Norrby, who styled himself the betrothed
of Christine Gyllenstierna and made ready to attack Gustavus
from the sea. Berndt von Melen, a German commander,
in whom Gustavus placed much confidence, was
to chase Norrby away from his stronghold, the island of
Gothland, but turned a traitor, joining Norrby instead, in
1524. Gustavus called a Riksdag at Westeros, in 1525,
resolved to use his diplomacy to the utmost. Upon receiving
a letter from the Dalecarlians, in which they stoutly
swore off their allegiance to him on account of heavy taxes,
foreign influence and disregard for the Church, the king
offered to abdicate. The representatives at the Riksdag
persuaded him to remain, whereupon the king sent the Dalecarlians
a sagacious letter, promising to improve the state of
things as much as possible, but pointing out the two prelates
as traitors in conspiracy with the Danes. The Dalecarlians
were pacified, Knut and Peder finding it safest to leave for
Norway. In the following year the king met the revolting
peasants of Upland at Old Upsala, where he in a fiery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
speech unfolded his policy toward the Church. The peasants
resented; they wanted to keep their monks and their
masses. The king commanded one of his followers to make
a speech in Latin, the peasants shouting that they did not
understand. “Why do you, then, love so dearly your Latin
mass?” the king asked them smiling. A few days later
Gustavus made a crushing speech against lazy and worthless
ecclesiastics before the chapter of Upsala. The archbishop
was sent away on diplomatic errands to Poland and
Russia never to return. After his departure Bishop Brask
became the chief representative of papal interests. He was
patriotic, but never yielded an inch of the worldly power of
the Church except to force, opposing the Reformation with
his whole strength.</p>

<p>The king followed up his policy by demanding for the
crown two-thirds of the ecclesiastic tithe and by placing
the ecclesiastics under the duties of <i>russtienst</i>, in 1526.
The ex-prelates, Knut and Peder, were, upon the king’s
request of an extradition, given up and sentenced to death
for high treason. The king arranged for their triumphal
entry of mockery into Stockholm in a most humiliating
fashion, for which he has been criticised; also for the consummate
manner in which the judges were appointed and
judgment passed. But he set an example of warning to
obnoxious and intriguing prelates that was appreciated by
his contemporaries.</p>

<p>Gustavus gained the triumph of his policy by the famous
Riksdag of Westeros in 1527. It was nothing else than a
coup d’état, a revolution, which, with the establishment
of the Reformation, gave his throne solidity and resources.
The Diet was called under the pretext of taking measures
against a new revolt in Dalecarlia and for the regulation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
dogmatic questions. There were present sixteen state councillors,
four bishops, one hundred and twenty-nine knights
and nobles, one hundred and five peasants, besides various
priests, burghers and miners, but no representatives from
Finland or Dalecarlia. In the great hall of the monastery
the meeting was held, opening with a written address by
the king, read by his chancellor, in which the situation
of the country was set forth. The king refused to continue
at the government, asking to be remunerated for personal
losses and expense, and given a fief like any ordinary
bailiff responsible to the crown. Only if fundamental reforms
were made would he remain, not being able otherwise
to cover the inevitable deficit of the treasury. Bishop Brask
responded with the statement that he for his part was in
duty bound to the king, but that Rome and its demands
must, in the first place, be obeyed; showing by his remarks
that he understood that the question was one of reducing
the ecclesiastical power. The king rose and said in a burst
of passion: “We have no further desire, then, to be your
king. Verily, we had counted on quite another treatment
at your hands. We now no longer wonder at the perversity
of the people, since they have such advisers. Have
they no rain, they blame us for it. Have they no sun,
likewise. For dearth, hunger and plague we are responsible,
as if we were not a man, but God. Yea, though we
labor for you with our utmost power, both in spiritual and
in temporal affairs, you would gladly see the axe upon our
neck, but no one dares to grasp the handle. Monks and
priests and all the creatures of the pope are to be placed
above us, though we have little need of them. In a word,
you all would lord it over us. Who under such circumstances
would desire to govern you? Not the worst wretch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
in hell would wish the post, far less any man. Therefore
we, too, refuse to be your king. We cast the honor from
us, and leave you free to choose him whom you will. But
be so kind as to let us leave the land. Pay us for our
property in the kingdom, and return to us what we have
expended in your service. Then we declare to you that
we will withdraw never to return.” With tears of anger
and emotion the king left the hall, leaving the assembly
in consternation.</p>

<p>After four days of pandemonium and deadlock, the representatives
decided to give in and ask forgiveness of the
king, who long disregarded the appeals made for his return.
When re-entering he was greeted by commotion and the
humblest demonstrations of respect and repentance. The
next day, Midsummer day, votes were taken upon his propositions,
each Estate of representatives sending up their vote
with a written construction of the propositions. These were
then revised by the state councillors in their final form,
called “Westeros Recess,” with amendments called “Westeros
Ordinantia.” The startling revolutionary stipulations
of the “Recess” were chiefly these: Authority for the king
(1) to take in possession the castles and forts of the bishops,
whose retinues he was to fix as to numbers; (2) to dispose
of the superfluous income of the clergy and to superintend
the administration of the monasteries; authority for the
nobility to resume title to all their property which had
come in the possession of the Church since 1454; authority
to have the Gospel preached all over the country in
undefiled purity. Among the “Ordinantia” the most important
were: (1) Vacancies in the parish churches were
to be filled by the bishop under the supervision and right
of suspension of the king; (2) the king was to fix the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
amount of revenue due the bishops, chapters and clerks,
and be entitled to use the surplus for the crown; (3) the
priests were in secular suits to be responsible to secular
courts; (4) the Gospel should be read in the schools. The
king asked the bishops in person to surrender their castles,
to which demand they all agreed.</p>

<p>We may feel inclined to smile upon the drastic manner
in which Gustavus enacted this important drama of Revolution,
but must bear in mind his solitary position. He had
no statesmen of ability at his side, nor men of great intellect
and power to sustain him. He stood alone, and few knew
as yet his superior qualities as a statesman and an organizer.
The tame opposition, soon yielding to the appeals of
the burghers and peasants, can only be explained through
lack of leaders. Ture Jœnsson (Tre Rosor), the aristocratic
chief of the opposition, was a vain and cowardly man.
Bishop Brask, the head of the clergy, was old and more
of a diplomatist than a man of action. The latest stanch
Romanist, he gave up his cause, finding a pretext to leave
the country and dying in his self-imposed exile. The ecclesiastical
reforms were definitively arranged at a church
meeting at Œrebro in the following year.</p>

<p>It was one of the evils which beset the reign of Gustavus
that revolts constantly occurred in various provinces and for
various reasons. Dalecarlia took the lead. The inhabitants
were not able to bear the distinction won by their great
patriotic services in the times of Engelbrekt, the Stures,
and Gustavus. Their complaints were mostly unreasonable,
sometimes ridiculous, as when they tried to prescribe
the kind of cloth and colors to be used at court, and so forth.
There was no fable, however stupid, which was not readily
believed by them and the responsibility placed on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
king. Particularly was everything eagerly swallowed which
spoke of injustice committed against the descendants of
the Stures. A daring pretender took advantage of this
fact. He was born of the lowest peasant class, serving
on an estate in Westmanland, where he had stolen a sum
of money from his master. Appearing in Dalecarlia, where
he claimed that he was a son of Lord Sten and Christine
Gyllenstierna, he gained a great deal of support among the
yeomen, who cried with him like children when he spoke
of his noble father and asked them to pray for his soul.
The false pretender had his instructions from Peder Sunnanvæder;
he married in Norway a woman of noble birth,
and, upon his return to Dalecarlia, surrounded himself with
a regular court. An end was put to his career by a letter
from Christine Gyllenstierna, written at the request of the
king, in which she told the Dalecarlians that her son Nils,
whom the pretender impersonated, had recently died, and
that an impostor was misleading them. The false Nils Sture
answered by claiming that he was born before marriage,
the would-be-reason why his mother did not acknowledge
him. This even the Dalecarlians found was a stretching of
truth. The pretender, who had been stamping coins with
his image and held the demeanor of a ruling prince, fled
to Norway and thence to Rostock, where he was captured
and beheaded. No blood was shed during this period of
revolt; but the king, who was crowned at Upsala in 1528,
proceeded from his coronation to Dalecarlia with an army
of 14,000 men. He commanded the Dalecarlians to meet
him, and forgave them after a severe sermon of reproach,
making them surrender the chief supporters of the “Daljunker,”
who were executed on the spot.</p>

<p>No better was the outcome of a revolt prepared by some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
nobles of West Gothland in the following year. They tried
in vain to make the population join with them. The king
managed to obtain their secret correspondence, and had the
guilty ones arraigned before a meeting at which he scrutinized
and repudiated the false charges made against him.
The nobles asked forgiveness and were pardoned, with the
exception of two, who were beheaded. But the originators
of the revolt had fled. They were Ture Jœnsson and
Bishop Magnus of Skara. The former joined the deposed
King Christian, who, in 1532, prepared an attack on Sweden
in his attempts to recapture his crowns. With him were
other such distinguished traitors as Gustavus Trolle and
Berndt von Melen. Gustavus I. sent a splendid army
to meet Christian near Kongelf. Christian withdrew in
disappointment, leaving Ture Jœnsson behind in the
streets of Kongelf, minus a head. Christian was imprisoned
by his uncle, Frederic of Denmark, and died
in captivity.</p>

<p>In order to pay the debt to Lubeck it was decided at a
meeting at Upsala, in 1530, that the bells of the churches
should be taken to be melted down. Concessions to do so
were asked and obtained from the various communities.
But upon the surrender of the bells discontent grew up.
In Dalecarlia it came to revolt and open violence. The
people refused to give up their bells or took the surrendered
ones back with force. Threatening letters were sent
to the king, who at first pretended to ignore the whole matter.
Christian was preparing his last attack, and prudence
deemed advisable. The inducements made by the Swedish
traitors to support Christian’s claims were scornfully repulsed
by the Dalecarlians, who still continued with their
insulting letters to the king. Gustavus answered them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
a peaceful way. In 1533, at New Year, he suddenly appeared
with an army in Dalecarlia, where the revolters also
this time received a severe reproach and were forced to give
up their leaders. These were executed, and that ended the
last revolt of Dalecarlia.</p>

<p>In the following year Sweden was forced into a war
which lasted up to 1536, the so-called “Feud of the Counts,”
the chief participants being the counts of Holstein, Oldenburg
and Hoya. Sweden sided with Christian of Holstein,
who fought for his rights to the throne of Denmark after
his father Frederic, being opposed by the other counts and
by Lubeck. Hard and repeated pressure was brought to
bear on Svante Sture, a son of Lord Sten and Christine
Gyllenstierna, to appear as a pretender against Gustavus;
but the noble youth, who was sojourning in Germany,
firmly withstood these temptations. His mother had married
John Turesson, a son of the traitor Ture Jœnsson, who
was as able a man as his father was a bad one, being the
successful commander of a Swedish army which invaded
the Danish provinces held by the count of Oldenburg. A
Swedish fleet, created through sacrifices of nobles and
peasants, distinguished itself repeatedly. The war ended
in the defeat of Lubeck.</p>

<p>Gustavus had, since the end of the work of liberation,
crushed the power of the Church, punished the revolting
peasants, kept the aristocracy within bounds, and put an
end to the supremacy of Lubeck. But he went still further,
trying to deprive the Church of its last vestige of authority,
to introduce a minute administration of the provinces and to
enforce the absolute power of the crown. To these plans he
was led by two foreign advisers, Georg Norman and Konrad
Pentinger. But it must be said to the credit of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
king that their influence vanished when he saw that their
“reforms” were not acceptable to the people. From this
period of his reign, one noteworthy and wholesome measure
remains, the reintroduction of the former hereditary order
of succession to the throne. It was formulated and accepted
at the Riksdag of Œrebro (Jan. 4, 1540), memorable also
through death sentences pronounced upon two of the apostles
of the Swedish Reformation. The king had long regarded
his chancellor and the two brothers, Olaus and
Laurentius Petri, the latter archbishop of Upsala, with
suspicion. The climax was reached when a conspiracy
by German burghers of Stockholm against the king’s life
was discovered, and it was proved that Olaus Petri and
Laurentius Andreæ were conscious of its purport, without
making it known to the king. They were condemned to
death, Archbishop Laurentius being forced to take a seat as
one of the judges, but pardoned at the request of the burghers
of Stockholm, on the grounds that the ministers had received
their knowledge on the pledge of secrecy through
confession. Laurentius Andreæ lost his position as the
king’s chancellor. In the following year each church
in the country was presented with a copy of the complete
translation of the Bible, the work of the two reformers.</p>

<p>The greatest, most serious and most expensive of peasants’
revolts was that called the Dacke Feud (1542 and
1543), after its leader Nils Dacke, a peasant born in Bleking,
emigrated to Smaland, which became the scene
of his revolt. The peasants were resolved to make war
on the royal bailiffs, the nobles and the new religion, and
found in Dacke an excellent leader, ferocious, daring and
of some military ability. The forces sent by the king to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
meet him were repeatedly routed. The king was seriously
alarmed, particularly since the revolt attracted attention
abroad and was encouraged by Emperor Charles V., in
the interests of the deposed Christian, his brother-in-law,
and by several German princes. The emperor wrote to
Nils Dacke a letter, preserved to this day, although it never
reached its destination, in which Charles, with pride, recalls
his Gothic (that is, according to the views of his time, Swedish)
origin: “Sumus et nos de gente Gothorum.” Nils
Dacke’s plan was to place Svante Sture on the throne. He
wrote him a letter to this effect, which the noble Sture
handed over to the king, together with the messenger who
brought it. After much effort the king gathered an army
of considerable strength, which was ordered against Dacke,
who was defeated at Lake Asund. He fled and was pursued
by the troops into Bleking, where he was captured and
shot. This revolt cost Gustavus dearly, but was a good
lesson in regard to the more immature of his reforms,
against which it, to a great extent, was directed.</p>

<p>Now the storms and trials of his reign were at an end,
and Gustavus allowed to gather the fruit of his wise management,
which itself grew wiser with his old age. In 1544
the Union of Succession of 1540 was confirmed at Westeros.
In matters of finance Gustavus laid the foundations of the
modern state. The bailiffs were multiplied and made to
give close accounts of the revenues. Fiefs granted to nobles
before were now kept by the crown. The great nobles who
held fiefs were placed under stricter control. The bloody
Christian did useful work for the crown by ridding it of
many unruly heads. The privileges granted by Westeros
Recess were enforced, but the king saw to it that the nobility
received back only what was properly due. But when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
the crown was concerned, property was taken from the
Church to the greatest tension of these privileges, and likewise
for the king’s private rights, by means of which less
scrupulous tactics both the state and the king were enriched.
The former came in possession of 12,000 farms,
the latter of 4,000, in his case called “inherited estates.”
As Gustavus was a great economizer, he left a treasury replete
with money and uncoined silver, in spite of elaborate
pomp on state occasions, expensive royal marriages and
wooings, and a feud with Russia. From which of the two
treasuries in his care expenses were paid, Gustavus was not
overparticular. He set a good example as a practical
farmer and agriculturist, the dairy at Gripsholm standing
under the personal supervision of the queen, with twenty-two
less ladylike assistants.</p>

<p>Gustavus created the nucleus to a standing army of hired
troops, of natives and foreigners, about 15,000 in numbers,
and provided Sweden with a considerable and well-equipped
fleet. He encouraged the mining industry by supporting
the silver mines of Sala and the copper mines of Falun.
He introduced the working of iron, according to new methods,
calling in German experts whose work he superintended
in person. Putting an end to the supremacy of the Hanseatic
commerce, he made treaties of commerce with the
Netherlands and France, making Helsingfors in Finland
the centre of the trade with Russia. On the western coast
he founded the new town of Elfsborg, and ordered the inhabitants
of New Lœdœse to move thither. To the common
people Gustavus held an attitude which shows
evidence of love and confidence. Many of his letters and
messages to them abound in hints at practical methods in
farming. The schools were improved and partly reorgan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>ized
through the spirit of Reformation, while the University
of Upsala lost in importance and prestige, the students again
going abroad.</p>

<p>The war with Russia, commencing in 1554, and marked
by mutual invasions, offered no aspect of importance, and
was ended by a treaty of peace in 1557.</p>

<p>The founder of the famous royal line of Vasa was, personally,
a man of prepossessing appearance, tall, and of
commanding presence, having blond hair and beard, sharp
blue eyes, full lips, rosy cheeks and a fine frame. He was
fond of costly garments, and the styles of his day were becoming
to him. Gustavus was of an amiable and cheerful disposition,
although of a quick temper. He had a rare gift
of winning the goodwill and confidence of all classes by
addressing everybody according to their compass of intellect
and conversation. He was fond of music, and played
and sang. The lute was his favorite instrument, which he
liked to play in his evenings of solitude. Gustavus possessed
a rare intellect and a remarkable memory. Well
aware of his own weakness to give way to his quick temper,
he generally postponed all decisive action in matters of importance
until sure of his full power of discernment. He
was not a brilliant genius, but a typical prince of the Renaissance
epoch, never afraid of taking action in instances
without a precedence, or of the consequences of his actions.
His letters and addresses evince an unusual degree
of common sense, clothed in a language of manly vigor,
terseness and humor, and are fine specimens of the modern
Swedish, such as it meets us in this its period of
rejuvenation, brought about by the spirit of the Reformation.
There is something in the oral and literary eloquence
of Gustavus Vasa which makes it easy to believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
that he was a descendant of Birgitta. Gustavus did not
possess the fine erudition of his sons, who were considered
to be men of learning in their time, for he early left his
university studies for the court and the war; but he was
able to pass such good opinions upon subjects of art and
science that he astonished many who had made these a
special study. He had the power of recognizing people
whose faces he once had noticed after ten to twenty
years of absence, and was also skilled in divining what
character dwelt behind every face. What he once heard
he never forgot. Where he had travelled once he could
never mistake the road, and knew not only the names of
the villages but also the names of the peasants whom he
had met. His life was led by the unswaying principles of
an earnest piety and high morals. His nephew, Peter
Brahe the Elder, who in a chronicle has given the above
picture of Gustavus Vasa, adds: “<i>In summa</i>, God had
bequeathed him, above others, with great ability, high intellect
and many princely virtues, so that he was well
worthy of carrying sceptre and crown. For he was not
only sagacious and kind above others, but also manly and
able. He was sharp and just in passing sentences, in many
cases being charitable and merciful.”</p>

<p>The royal court was characterized by a joyous and elevated
spirit. Every day after dinner all the courtiers collected
in the dancing hall. The lady of ceremonies then
entered with the ladies of the court, and the royal musicians
dispensed music for dancing. Every other or third
day the king went out hunting or horseback riding with
the gentlemen and ladies of his court. The youths of the
nobility once a week held exhibitions of fencing and
other knightly sport, the king taking an interested and ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>tive
part. Those who excelled received prizes in the form
of rings of gold or chaplets of pearls and led the dance of
the evening.</p>

<p>Gustavus I. was three times married. His first consort
was young neurotic Catherine, princess of Saxony-Lauenburg,
whom he married while the “Revolt of the Bells”
was going on in Dalecarlia, and who died four years later,
leaving him a son, Eric, of her own hysteric temperament.
Shortly after the death of Catherine, the king married a
young lady of the highest Swedish nobility, Margaret Leijonhufvud,
with whom he lived in a long and happy union,
ended by her death in 1551, and blessed by ten children,
among whom the sons John, Magnus and Charles. Lady
Margaret had been in love with the oldest son of Christine
Gyllenstierna, Svante Sture, whom she renounced, and
who married her younger sister Martha. Queen Margaret
was a tender and high-minded woman, who won the love
and absolute confidence of her royal consort, on whose quick
temper she exerted a quieting influence, comforting him
in hours of trouble and distress. She preserved as queen
the plain and severe habits of her youth, having a personal
superintendence over the dairies of the royal castles, especially
those of Gripsholm and Svartsjœ. She was interested
in brewing, baking and other household affairs, often making
with her own hands the clothes of her children. When
the king referred to Queen Margaret, he always called her
“our dear mistress of the house.” The king remained a
nobleman of his day in the purple. Royal splendor was displayed
on great occasions only. Simplicity was the principle
of every-day life. When entertaining his friends, the
king took great pains to please and arranged many details
himself. Upon one occasion of this kind at Gripsholm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
Queen Margaret carried in the sweetmeats and cookies,
while the king served the wine and asked his guests to be
glad and make merry.</p>

<p>Queen Margaret was suddenly taken ill while partaking
in a pleasure trip on Lake Mælar, and died in 1551, after a
touching farewell to her consort. In the following year the
king married the young Catherine Stenbock, a daughter of
Gustavus Stenbock, an intimate friend to the king, and
Lady Brita Leijonhufvud, a sister of Queen Margaret. In
the lives and fate of Catherine and Margaret there are
several remarkable coincidences. Like Queen Margaret,
Catherine was secretly in love with some one else when
the royal proposal was made. Strange enough the object
of Catherine’s secret affection was, like Margaret’s,
a son of Christine Gyllenstierna, Gustavus Johnsson Tre
Rosor. This young man was the grandson of conceited
Ture Jœnsson and the son of able John Turesson, the
second consort of Christine Gyllenstierna. The family
name was Tre Rosor, after the coat-of-arms, which consisted
of three roses. As her aunt Margaret must renounce
the hero of her dreams, so also Catherine. Like his half-brother,
Svante Sture, Gustavus Tre Rosor married the
sister of his first love, and this marriage, like that of
Svante, turned out a happy one. There was a last coincidence
in the life of the two queens. When Margaret
heard that the royal sponsor was coming, she knew his
errand and concealed herself in an oak chest in a distant
part of the castle of Ekeberg. Catherine, upon a similar
occasion, ran down in the gardens of Torpa and hid herself
behind a bush. The third marriage of the king was a
happy one, in spite of the great difference in years between
the consorts. The clergy tried to raise objections, holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
that Gustavus and Catherine were too nearly related to
make the marriage a legal one. After some severe pressure
these objections were finally dropped.</p>

<p>Queen Catherine thus expressed the state of her feelings
after her marriage: “Gustavus is dear to me, but I shall
never forget the Rose.”</p>

<p>The king gave scrupulous attention to the education of
his children. They were brought up in simplicity and sternness,
but received a manifold training and a great amount
of instruction. While they were studying at Upsala, hams
and butter were sent them from the royal estates to make
part of their breakfasts and suppers. In spite of these patriarchal
endeavors, Eric and John grew up to be typical Renaissance
princes, fond of extravagance and luxury. The
king wrote once to Duke Magnus: “Our dear Lady Catherine
sends thee five shirts which thou must bear in mind
to take good care of; <i>item</i>, to keep thy head clean and not
ride or run too much.” When his sons grew older, King
Gustavus used to admonish them orally before the hearth
or at the table, or by letters. His wise counsel recalls the
terse and sharp advice of Havamal in the Edda: “Ye shall
weigh all matters carefully, perform them quickly and
stand by it, putting nothing off to the morrow; counsel
not followed up in due time is like clouds without
rain in times of dearth.” “To speak once and stand
by it, is better than to talk one hundred times.” “Surround
ye ever with able men of pure living; one shall
believe of ye what one knows about them.” Duke Eric
early caused him trouble by stubbornness, defiance and
vanity. Duke John, the oldest child of Queen Margaret,
long remained his favorite, but ended by causing him
grief through disobedience and secret conspiracy with Eric.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
In his old age, King Gustavus suffered through failing
health and melancholy. He complained because the fate
of his country seemed uncertain on account of the unstability
of his sons, and because his old friends, like John
Turesson and Christine Gyllenstierna, passed away before
him, leaving him alone in the world.</p>

<p>When King Gustavus felt that the end was drawing
near, he sent word to the four Estates or representative
classes of the country, the nobles, clergymen, burghers and
yeomen, to meet him at Stockholm around the Midsummer
of 1560. He made known to the Estates his will, which his
sons pledged themselves by oath to fulfil. Eric should inherit
the crown, according to the will, but the three other
sons were to receive duchies which they should govern with
a good deal of authority. It became evident that the king
had taken pains to provide liberally for his sons. But it appears
as if he intended to make them all responsible in the
maintenance of the work of their father, by distributing
the power between them.</p>

<p>When the Estates had collected in the hall of state the
old monarch entered with his sons. After greeting those
present he delivered his farewell address:</p>

<p>“I respect the power of God, which with me has reinstalled
the ancient royal line on the throne of Sweden. Ye
have without doubt learned, and those of you who are somewhat
advanced in years have seen for yourselves, how our dear
fatherland, already for ages in distress and misery through
foreign lordship, at last suffered the same through the grim
despot King Christian, and how it pleased God to liberate
us from this tyranny through me. For this it behooves us,
high and low, master and servant, old and young, never to
forget that same divine help. For what of a man was I to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
set myself against a mighty king, who not only ruled three
kingdoms, but who also was related to the powerful emperor
Charles V. and the noble princes of Germany. But
God has performed the work, made me the worker of his
miracle, and been my help and comfort during a reign of
forty years, the cares of which have hastened me on with
gray hairs to the grave. Forsooth, I could liken myself to
King David,” and the tears came to his eyes, “whom God
from a shepherd made to a reigning king over his people. I
could not divine that glory, when I in woods and desert
fells must needs conceal myself from the bloodthirsty
swords of my enemies. Grace and blessing have in a wide
measure been granted both me and you through the knowledge
of God’s true Gospel, also in the shape of material
abundance, which is evident all through the land, thank the
Lord. If during my reign anything good has been accomplished,
give ye God the glory of it. But for what there
has been of failure and fault, I beg you, as faithful subjects,
to forbear and forgive. God is my witness that it has not
been by meanness, but by human weakness, that I have not
been able to do better. My ambition has always been the
improvement and welfare of the people of my country. I
know full well that I have been a severe king in the eyes
of many. Yet that day shall come when the children of
Sweden willingly would dig me up from under the sod if
that they could. My time soon is at an end. I need not in
the stars or other signs search for my last moment; my
body is to me the trustworthy messenger that I soon shall
stand before the severe King of kings, to give account
for the glorious but earthly crown of Sweden which I
have worn.”</p>

<p>The Estates listened with great emotion to the words of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
the old monarch. After the king had ceased speaking and
his will had been sanctioned, Gustavus left the assembly
supported by his sons and nodding his farewell to those
standing near. Three months later he was taken ill, and
September 29, 1560, the great liberator, revolutionist and
organizer of his country expired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Reformation and Reaction&mdash;The Sons of Gustavus I.</i></span></h2>

<p>Eric XIV. succeeded his father in 1560, commencing
his reign under the most brilliant of auspices. But
the old King Gustavus had foreseen that his sons
would cause danger to the realm which he with infinite care
had built up. After his forty years’ work of construction
followed forty years of destruction which his elder sons
brought to bear upon it. Fortunately, that work was so
solid that it withstood this bravely, to rise rejuvenated
when loving hands anew were laid to it.</p>

<p>King Eric was one of the most gifted monarchs of his
time, handsome, eloquent, learned, a fine linguist, a musician
and artist. But his sharp reason carried him to the
excess of suspicion, his artistic temperament into hysterics,
and he was vain, overbearing, quick-tempered, licentious
and cruel. His leaning toward mysticism made him devoted
to astrology.</p>

<p>Eric’s first ambition was to reduce the power of the
dukes, convoking a Riksdag at Arboga, in 1561, where
the “Arboga Articles” were formulated for such purpose,
the dukes being forced to acquiesce. In order to reduce the
distance between the dukes and the nobility, King Eric, at
his coronation&mdash;celebrated with a lavish display of pomp at
Upsala in June of the same year&mdash;instituted hereditary dig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>nities
of counts and barons. Svante Sture, Peter Brahe the
Elder and Gustavus Johnsson Tre Rosor were created
counts, the first and third one the sons of Christine
Gyllenstierna, Peter Brahe being a cousin of Gustavus
Vasa. Among the barons were Sten Leijonhufvud, Gustavus
Stenbock, relatives of the dukes, and Clas Kristersson
Horn (of Aminne). Only small fiefs were given with the
new dignities, which were nothing but an outward sign of
the distinction existing between a higher aristocracy already
extant and the lower nobility. In order to strengthen his
connection with the nobles, Eric made the estate on which
a noble fixed his domicile exempt from <i>russtjenst</i>. He was
jealous of his power and dignity, for which reasons he held
sharp supervision over his officials. He instituted a supreme
court, consisting of twelve men of low birth, who
every three years made a tour of the country to hold court
in the name of the king. These justices were the creatures
of Eric, and soon brought on themselves discredit and hatred
through their servile and cruel acts. Among these justices
was Gœran Persson, an able and powerful man, revengeful
and cruel, who soon rose to be the favorite and influential
adviser of his master.</p>

<p>Eric was intent upon making a great match, wooing
Elizabeth of England, Mary Stuart of Scotland, Renata of
Lothringia and Christine of Hesse, with more or less success,
overlooking Margaret of Valois, who was anxious to
marry him. His mistress, Carin Monsdotter, a child of the
people, but beautiful and of a noble character, for whom he
had formed a secret attachment, finally was made his queen.</p>

<p>The German Order which held Esthonia and Livonia
suffered during this period considerably through Russian invasions.
The town of Reval, with a large part of Esthonia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
was ceded to Sweden in 1562, upon the receipt of a loan,
Eric immediately giving his attention to the depressed and
enslaved peasants of that section. Later the grandmaster
of the Order turned Livonia over to the king of Poland,
who, in need of money, placed seven castles of this province
at the disposal of John, duke of Finland. John had tendered
a loan to the Polish king and married his sister Catherine.
Eric considered these negotiations as harmful to his
royal authority, and he asked his brother to give account of
them in person. John refused, making the royal emissaries
his prisoners. The Swedish Riksdag condemned John to
death for high treason, and an army was despatched to Finland,
which carried back Duke John and his consort as prisoners.
John’s sentence was commuted to imprisonment at
Gripsholm, proud Catherine choosing to share the fate of
her husband (1563). The prison life of the ducal couple
at Gripsholm was not an unpleasant one. They enjoyed
a great deal of liberty and luxury at the splendid castle in
Lake Mælar, King Eric sending his brother a copy of Boccaccio’s
“Decamerone” in German, to read for a pastime.
The duke read the work and translated it into Swedish.
The room called “king John’s prison,” which is still preserved
with the artistic decoration which Duke Charles later
bestowed on it, served as sleeping apartment for the prisoners,
and there Catherine gave life to two children, one of
whom was to become the founder of the Polish line of Vasa
kings. It is said that Duke Magnus became a prey to the
disposition of insanity latent in his family, by being forced
to sign the death sentence of his brother John, King Eric being
anxious of having him share the responsibility. Magnus
lived until quite an advanced age, but was never cured of
his mental ailment. Even in his best hours he was not of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
very bright intellect. While sojourning at the castle of Vadstena,
by the Lake Vetter, he had the vision of a mermaid,
who coaxed him to follow her. The duke jumped from the
window of his apartment into the moat below. He did not
sustain any serious injury, but the incident made the unhappy
prince famous in tradition and song.</p>

<p>In May, 1560, a war commenced with Denmark which,
with several intermissions, lasted for seven years. It has
been called The Seven Years’ War of the North. About the
same time that Eric became king of Sweden, the young
ambitious Frederic II. ascended the throne of Denmark.
In the days of Gustavus I., Christian III. had appropriated
the Swedish emblem of three crowns for the Danish seal of
state, as if by this proclaiming that the Union was considered
still extant or that it could be re-established at the opportune
moment. King Gustavus had protested, but with
no result. When King Frederic kept up the irritating fact
of preserving the Swedish emblem, King Eric answered
by placing the emblems of Denmark and Norway in the
Swedish seal of state. This made things worse and served
as a nominal cause for war. The principal interest at stake
was the supremacy in the Baltic provinces. The diocese of
Œsel, which had accepted a Danish protectorate, was governed
by a brother of the Danish king, who had entered into
an alliance with Poland against Sweden, Denmark also joining
it.</p>

<p>In May, 1563, a Swedish fleet, commanded by Jacob
Bagge, left Sweden to bring Princess Christine of Hesse,
the promised bride of King Eric. A Danish fleet met them,
at the island of Bornholm, and greeted the Swedish ships
with some shots from their sharply loaded cannon. The
Swedes returned the fire and a naval battle followed, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
ended in a defeat for the Danes, who lost their flagship.
When Jacob Bagge arrived in Rostock, where he was to
meet the princess, her father was found unwilling to let her
sail on account of the insecurity brought about by the commencing
naval hostilities. This would under ordinary circumstances
have enraged the vain and sensitive king, but
Eric forgot his rage in his delight at the naval victory.
Jacob Bagge was rewarded with a triumphal entry into
Stockholm upon his return. He entered the city on foot
with a golden chain round his neck, followed by his sub-commanders
and surrounded by the banners taken during
the battle. The prisoners followed, in chains and with
shaved heads. The king’s fool was dancing in front of
them, playing on his fiddle. A Danish herald soon afterward
reached Stockholm, declaring war with great pomp
and ceremony on behalf of his royal master. The city of
Lubeck sent a messenger to Stockholm on a similar errand,
but was not received by the king. “Since he is sent by the
mayor and council of his town and other similar lard-mongers,
let him be heard and answered by the mayor and
council of Stockholm,” was the royal order.</p>

<p>Jacob Bagge was ordered to sea with the Swedish fleet
later in the summer of the same year. He met the united
fleets of Denmark and Lubeck at the island of Œland, in the
Baltic. A terrible battle ensued, which lasted until the
fleets were separated by the darkness of the night, without
victory being won by either side. Jacob Bagge started out
with his fleet again in the spring of the following year, commanding
a new flagship, “The Matchless,” which carried
two hundred cannon, most of them made out of church bells
confiscated by Gustavus Vasa. A new battle was delivered
between the islands of Gothland and Œland. The majority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
of the Swedish ships had by a gale been separated from the
admiral and his flagship, but Jacob Bagge fought valiantly
for a whole day, continuing the battle the next morning. A
catastrophe brought it to a close. “The Matchless” caught
fire through some act of negligence, a barrel of powder exploding
between the decks. Jacob Bagge then surrendered,
and was taken on board one of the ships of Lubeck. The
enemies took possession of the “The Matchless” in order to
plunder it, but the immense ship exploded with a tremendous
roar, sinking with everybody who was on board. Jacob
Bagge did not long remain in Danish captivity. He returned,
to be greeted with the greatest distinction, and died
as governor-general of Stockholm.</p>

<p>The war on land was at the beginning carried on only
through mutual invasions, both sides giving proofs of cruelty
and vandalism. Elfsborg surrendered to the Danes.
A Swedish army, commanded by King Eric in person, entered
the province of Halland, pillaging and plundering and
laying siege to the town of Halmstad. King Eric suddenly
raised the siege, when news came that King Frederic was
approaching with an army. The Swedish troops scattered
in various directions, one division being met and defeated
by the Danes. The whole of Northern Norway was invaded
by Swedish troops and temporarily subjugated. The
entire kingdom of Norway was very near being altogether
absorbed by Sweden. This would have been a happy solution
of the Scandinavian question. Norway would have
become one in language with Sweden and would have shared
her glorious epoch of political grandeur which was to follow.
The best families of Norway would have been entered side
by side with the Swedish nobility at the knightly chapterhouse
of Stockholm, and the countries would have had their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
later democratic and cultural development in common. But
King Eric was too restless and undecided to make any lasting
conquest, or union, possible. When Claude Collard, a
young French nobleman, who was the conqueror of Northern
Norway, was taken by surprise and captured, King
Eric, to avenge this, devastated forty church parishes in
Norway. The Danes invaded and plundered the provinces
of West Gothland and Smaland, while the Swedes pillaged
Bleking and Scania. The king had given orders
that the population of a whole district should be killed. He
wrote later about the fulfilment of this cruel command:
“God granted luck, so that thousands of men were killed
on the road and in the woods.” The province of Scania
was devastated to a distance of one hundred miles from the
Swedish frontier. A new invasion into Halland was made,
in 1565, when Duke Charles, then fifteen years of age, commanded
the artillery. The town of Varberg was attacked,
but valiantly defended by the Danes. The young duke upon
this occasion gave the first proof of his indomitable energy.
He led the attack and persuaded the Swedes, by word and
action, not to give it up. At last the walls were taken, the
town being pillaged and burned. All men who could carry
arms were killed, except a force of one hundred and fifty
men of hired troops who entered Swedish service. A young
French captain, Pontus de la Gardie, of a noble family of
Languedoc, was among the latter. This man and his descendants
were destined to play an important part in
Swedish history.</p>

<p>Clas Kristersson Horn was made commander of the
Swedish navy after Jacob Bagge, in which position he covered
his name with glory. He won a naval battle at Œland
(in 1564) which lasted for two days. In the next year he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
added several victorious battles to his record, among which
the principal ones were fought at Buchow, by the coast of
Mecklenburg, and at the island of Bornholm. When he
went to sea in the spring of 1566 no enemy dared appear.
The united fleets of Denmark and Lubeck at last started
out, but were defeated by Clas Horn at the island of
Œland after a vehement battle. The vanquished fleets were
caught in a gale in which sixteen ships perished with seven
thousand men. Clas Horn with his Swedish fleet was master
of the sea. In the following year no fleet appeared to
meet his. The efforts of Gustavus I. to set the Swedish
fleet in good order thus proved to be of the greatest consequence.</p>

<p>The Danes were superior in the hostilities on land during
the latter part of the war, thanks principally to their eminent
commander, Daniel Rantzau. He made an unsuccessful
attempt to recapture the town of Varberg, but gained, at
Axtorna, a battle over a superior Swedish army (in 1565).
When Rantzau saw the Swedes approaching for an attack,
he held prayer with his troops, whereupon he arranged them
for resistance. The Swedish infantry captured the Danish
stronghold and artillery, but the hired German troops of the
Swedish wings turned into flight. Rantzau made an attack
upon the deserted infantry, and was victorious when nightfall
ended the battle. The Swedes lost thirty cannon, and Nils
Sture, the son of Count Svante Sture, was able to save the
banner of state only by severing it from the pole and hiding
it on his person. In the following year, Rantzau pillaged
Smaland and West Gothland, and in 1567 he penetrated as
far as East Gothland, where he was very near being caught
in a trap by the Swedish troops. The interior struggle of
Sweden caused hostilities to cease for some time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>The sad fate of his brother Magnus also befell King Eric.
Evidences of approaching insanity were frequent and brought
on horrible consequences. By licentiousness, mysticism and
astrological speculations his mind became unsettled. It had
been predicted that a blond man would dethrone him. Eric
at first made his brother John the subject of his suspicions.
After the duke’s imprisonment he suspected a rival in Nils
Sture, who also was a blond. Eric accused him of ill behavior
in the battle of Axtorna. The king’s court sentenced
him to death, but Lord Nils escaped with a contumelious
entry of mockery into Stockholm, on a miserable horse, and
a crown of straw on his head. But frightened at the indignation
aroused by his shameful act the king tried to undo it,
and sent Lord Nils on an embassy to Lothringia, to bring
the king’s proposal to Princess Renata.</p>

<p>In the commencement of 1567, the king had several of
the nobles arrested, on the suspicion of conspiracy, and carried
to the castle of Upsala, where a Riksdag was convoked.
Nils Sture arrived with the consent and betrothal ring of
Princess Renata, but was thrown into prison. The king
asked the Riksdag to pass a sentence of death upon the
accused nobles. When this was refused, he was seized by
fear and rage. Rushing into the prison of Nils Sture, he
wounded him in the arm. Lord Nils drew out the weapon,
a dagger, kissing its handle and returning it to the king,
with a prayer for mercy, but was killed by the soldiers at
the command of the king. Eric’s disposition immediately
was changed, and he darted into Count Svante’s prison,
begging forgiveness at his feet. The aged Sture’s answer
was that he would forgive all, granted that no harm was
done to his son. The king fled in despair from the castle
and town, followed by some of his soldiers, one of whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
sent back with an order to kill all the nobles, “except Lord
Sten.” As there were two by that name, these were spared,
but Count Svante and his son Eric Sture, Abraham Stenbock
and Ivar Ivarsson were killed. The Riksdag was forced to
pass sentence for high treason upon the murdered men, at
the instigation of Gœran Persson, whose perfidious advice
had continually inflamed the sickened brain of his master.
King Eric was for several days missing, and at last found
wandering about in a peasant’s garb. Cared for by Carin
Monsdotter, he slowly regained his reason, showing evidence
of repentance by declaring the murdered nobles innocent and
promising to compensate their families. During this spell
he set free his brother John and dismissed Gœran Persson.
But soon his evil disposition returned, and the resolution of
his brothers to free the country from his rule must be acknowledged
as a beneficent one. The nobles were brought
to revolt, when Eric, in July, 1568, proclaimed Carin as his
consort, and had her solemnly crowned Queen of Sweden.
The dukes John and Charles were at first unsuccessful in
their efforts, the king defeating their troops repeatedly.
But in 1569 Stockholm was captured, Gœran Persson killed
and the king forced to abdicate. The sentence passed upon
Eric, by the Estates of the Riksdag, stipulated that he
should be “imprisoned, but sustained in a princely manner,
for the rest of his days.”</p>

<p>Eric was at first held imprisoned in his own apartments
at the royal castle, but was transferred to two of the vaults,
called the “apartments of Lord Eskil.” They had served as
a treasury during the reign of Gustavus I., but now stood
empty. Queen Carin and her children were his company.
After an unsuccessful attempt at flight, one room was taken
away from him and the windows in the remaining one re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>duced
in size. The table of the royal prisoner was well provided
for, but he was unmercifully treated by his warders.
The cruel Olof Stenbock once deprived him of all his clothes.
In a struggle which followed, he shot Eric in the arm and
let him remain senseless in his blood for several hours.
Some of the members of the former body-guard of Eric
once attempted, but in vain, to set free the unhappy prisoner.
In 1569 Eric was removed to Abo in Finland, where
he was locked up in a secure prison. Two years later he
was taken to Castellholm, in the archipelago of Aland, for
fear that the Russian czar would liberate him by violence.
Shortly afterward he was removed to the lovely castle of
Gripsholm, where he had spent some of the happiest days of
his youth, and where he once upon a time held his brother
John imprisoned. At Gripsholm there is a gloomy dungeon
which is said to have served as the prison of King Eric, but
this is not authentic. Eric was treated comparatively well
while at Gripsholm, enjoying the company of his family, a
good table and plenty of servants. The recording books of
the castle from this period speak of “the court of King
Eric.” King John was, in the meantime, irritated by Russian
hostilities and intrigues, the old supporters of Eric joining
in the latter. The appeals of Duke Charles for the
improvement of the condition of his poor imprisoned
brother roused the suspicion of the king, who fostered dark
plots against the prisoner. Eric was removed from Gripsholm
and its pleasant associations, separated from his family
and put in hard prison at Westeros. The warders received
instructions to take his life if necessary. The state
council and the archbishop sanctioned this order of the king.
The last prison of the unhappy King Eric was Œrbyhus,
where he suddenly died, exactly at a time when King John’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
fears of a revolt had reached a climax. Rumors that Eric
had been poisoned were current, and Duke Charles also gave
utterance of his belief that such was the case. In spite of
the wars, cruelty and evil deeds of King Eric XIV., the
Swedish people of his time had a good deal of devotion for
him and his faithful consort. The country enjoyed good
years during his reign and profited by the wise measures
of his father.</p>

<p>Gustavus, the son of Eric XIV. and Carin Monsdotter,
was born, in 1568, at Nykœping. When Queen Carin was
separated from her imprisoned consort, her children, Gustavus
and Sigrid, followed her to Finland, where she resided
at Abo. In 1575 the young prince was harshly taken
away from his mother, at the command of the state council,
and sent to Prussia. The jealous and uneasy King John
made him the subject of cruel persecutions. In spite of these
he received a fine education, and is known to have embraced
the Catholic religion. He was kindly received by King Sigismund
of Poland, his cousin, at whose coronation in Cracow
he is said to have been present, in the disguise of a beggar.
A relation of intimate friendship existed between the outlawed
prince and Emperor Rudolph of Austria, both of
whom were devoted to the study of alchemy. King John
refused to listen to the appeals for grace and support which
Gustavus repeatedly made to him. Gustavus was not allowed
to see his mother until the year of 1596, when the
two had a touching meeting at Reval. He later made his
home in Thorn, but left for Russia, in 1600, upon an invitation
from Czar Boris. He was received in Moscow as a
reigning prince; but when he refused to appear as a pretender
to the Swedish throne, he was imprisoned. At the
fall of Boris, Gustavus was set free, but again put in prison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
by Dimitri. At the fall of the latter, in 1607, Gustavus once
more regained his liberty, but died in Casijn, in the same
year. This unhappy Gustavus Ericsson Vasa was a man of
fine erudition and pure morals. He was a dreamer and of a
sensitive disposition, being an ardent Catholic and fondly
devoted to the country which had outlawed him.</p>

<p>Sigrid Vasa, the daughter of Eric XIV., was twice married
to members of the Swedish nobility. Ake Henricsson
Tott, her son of the first marriage, was a distinguished warrior
in the times of Gustavus II. Adolphus. Queen Carin
died, in 1612, beloved and highly respected, at the beautiful
estate of Liuksiala in Finland, given her in fief by King
John.</p>

<p><i>John III.</i> succeeded Eric, without sharing his power
with his younger brother Charles, as he had promised.
John was as learned and highly talented as Eric, and as
vain, restless and unreliable. But while Eric was a mystic
and a sceptic by turns, John was a Catholic, or leaning toward
Catholicism, and a hypocrite who, under the pretence of
meekness and piety, tried to hide his vanity, bad temper
and utter selfishness. Like Gustavus I. and all his other
sons, John was devoted to the fine arts, particularly to architecture,
with an ardor that reached the vehemence of a passion.
He planned a vast number of churches and castles,
which he completed, utterly regardless of cost. The Swedish
Castle Renaissance which was established by John and
his brothers is influenced by contemporary Flemish art,
severe and majestic in outline, graceful and profuse in interior
decoration. Good specimens of it were the earlier
castles of Stockholm and Svartsjœ, the castle of Vadstena
remains so and, to a great extent, the beautiful and memorable
castle of Gripsholm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>At his coronation, John issued hereditary privileges to
the nobility. <i>Russtjenst</i> became no longer essential. Legal
offices were preserved for the nobles, the king’s supreme
court being abandoned. John’s policy was to win the support
of the aristocracy against Charles, who, indignant and
sulky, kept within his duchy, consisting of the provinces of
Sœdermanland and Vermland, with the town of Œrebro in
addition.</p>

<p>In 1570, an unsatisfactory peace was made with Denmark,
Sweden ceding all the Norwegian and Danish territory
in her possession, together with the island of Gothland,
and agreeing to pay something like one hundred and fifty
thousand dollars for the return of Elfsborg, held by the
Danes. A friendly relation to hostile Poland commenced
with John’s reign, but a long and bloody war with Russia
began in 1570. The Russians tried repeatedly, but in vain,
to capture Reval, plundering and killing the population of
Esthonia, who remained faithful to Swedish rule. Henric
Horn and Clas Tott won laurels for their heroic deeds, while
the war was changed into more modern methods and to a
successful issue by the Swedish general Pontus de la Gardie,
who captured the provinces Keksholm and Ingermanland
and the town of Narva.</p>

<p>John III. had set two goals for his ambition: to return the
Swedish church to Catholicism and to make his son Sigismund
king of Poland. The latter he reached at the death
of King Stephan in 1589, Sigismund succeeding him upon
the throne. The former ambition John never attained,
after years of stubborn and unreasonable perseverance giving
up this pet idea. John made some attempts to bring
order in the confused conditions of the church, but left it in
a worse state of confusion than he found it. The crown and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
the aristocracy had deprived the church of nearly all its
property and withheld its income from it. Archbishop
Laurentius Petri complained of the miserable state of
things, the ministers often being useless wretches and the
service in some churches impossible to uphold for sheer lack
of money. In 1572 the ecclesiastical matters were arranged
at a meeting in Upsala, when a new church law was introduced,
demanding higher qualifications for the ministers,
who were to be elected by their congregations, and enforcing
a school law. Laurentius Petri died in 1573 and was
succeeded by Laurentius Petri Gothus. The new archbishop
willingly subscribed to a set of rules, laid before
him by the king, which reintroduced monasteries, worship
of saints and the ceremonies of the Roman church. Jesuits
were invited to the country, but met with little encouragement
from the people. The very climax of John’s reactionary
movements was formed by the introduction of his ritual,
Liturgia, which was nothing else than an adaptation of the
Catholic ritual. It was accepted by the Riksdag of 1577,
but Charles refused to accept it for his duchy. The king
had many conflicts with his brother, the latter always giving
in to his wishes, except on this point. Ministers and
university professors who refused to conform to the new
ritual, or attacked it, were sheltered by the duke and, in
many instances, given high offices. The king grew angry,
but the duke remained firm and unyielding. When Queen
Catherine died, in 1583, John’s Catholic fervor suffered a
relapse, and ceased altogether after his marriage to young
Protestant Gunilla Bielke, in the following year. He stubbornly
stuck to his Liturgia for some time yet, but exiled
the Jesuits, and dismissed with contumely ministers who
had joined the Roman Church. During the last years of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
his reign, he said it was best to leave everybody a free
choice in religious matters, regretting his Liturgia&mdash;which
he once considered the gem of his own theological system&mdash;because
it had caused so much trouble and confusion.</p>

<p>Sweden suffered a great deal through the slack and
unsteady government of King John. He spent unreasonable
sums on his court and his craze for architectural marvels,
while always short of funds for the necessities of war
and internal improvements. Commerce and industries suffered
and were brought to a standstill by dearth, hunger and
pest. The population decreased; the towns were made
bankrupt and many farms abandoned. Bad and greedy
officials and the recommencing war with Russia increased
the evils. After unsuccessful attempts to have his son leave
Poland, where he had met with many difficulties, John entered
into more intimate relations with his brother, who
came to wield a beneficial influence on the government.
John III. died 1592, malcontent and tired of life, his death
being little regretted by the people.</p>

<p>One of the most famous love episodes of Sweden dates
from the reign of John III. It has no bearing upon the
affairs of state, but is not devoid of value as an illustration
of the history of civilization, giving us a glimpse of the private
life of the nobles of that period and the standard of
morals of their lives. The episode is told by Countess Anne
Banér in a manuscript by her hand with the title: “In the
following manner my blessed mother’s sister, Lady Sigrid
Sture, lady of Salestad and Geddeholm, related what took
place when Lord Eric Gustafson Stenbock carried away
our blessed mother’s sister, Magdalen Sture, from Hœrningsholm.”</p>

<p>The dowager-countess, Martha Sture, resided at the cas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>tle
of Hœrningsholm, enlarged to a four-story structure and
fortified with four corner towers by her consort. She was
a sister of Queen Margaret, the second queen of Gustavus
I., and was married to the renounced lover of that sister,
Count Svante Sture. The countess was called “King Martha,”
partly because of her stern power and great authority,
partly because it was known to have been her ambition to
see her husband’s family grace the throne of a country
which their forefathers had ruled as uncrowned kings. She
had lived to see her husband and two sons killed by the
insane Eric XIV., but she had yet two sons who would
carry high the glorious name, on which there was not a
stain of any kind. There were five daughters, Sigrid and
Anne, married to members of the influential Bielke family,
and Magdalen, Margaret and Christine, as yet unmarried.
There was another young lady at Hœrningsholm, besides
the daughters, the little Princess Sigrid Vasa, the daughter
of King Eric XIV. and Carin Monsdotter, who had received
a home with the stern “King Martha” while her mother
was following the tracks of the deposed monarch from
prison to prison.</p>

<p>Between Magdalen Sture and Lord Eric Stenbock a passionate
love sprang up. Lord Eric was a very fine young
man, of an influential family and the brother of the queen-dowager,
Catherine, third consort of Gustavus I. But, unfortunately,
he was the nephew of Countess Martha, and,
as a cousin of Magdalen, considered to be too closely related
to her to make a marriage possible. Countess Martha was
unwilling to listen to any appeals, and she was strengthened
in her resolution by the old Archbishop Laurentius Petri,
who still held the same opinions as when he, once upon a
time, refused to grant his consent to a marriage between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
King Gustavus I. and young Lord Eric’s sister, because
she was a niece of Queen Margaret. The years passed by,
but no change came in the stubborn resistance of “King
Martha.” Christmas eve of 1573, Lord Eric visited Hœrningsholm
to remain until New Year. He brought with him
costly presents which he offered as New Year’s gifts to
Countess Martha, her daughters, chaplain and servants.
He left to return on Palm Sunday with his sister Cecilia,
the wife of Count Gustavus Tre Rosor. One morning a few
days later, Lady Sigrid Bielke, who was visiting her mother,
entered the so-called rotunda, a large room in one of the
towers which Countess Martha and her daughters used as
sleeping apartment. She was surprised to find her sister
Magdalen kneeling and in tears. Lady Sigrid greeted her:
“God bless you, you have a good deed in mind!” “God
grant it were good,” answered Magdalen, rising. “Certainly
it is good to make one’s prayers amid tears,” Sigrid
said. Magdalen caught the hands of her sister and said:
“My darling sister, if all the rest forsake me, you will not
turn away your faithful heart from me.” Sigrid found the
words and emotion of her sister strange, but did not suspect
anything. “Why do you use such words to me?” she answered.
“I do not believe that you are going to make an
evil-doer out of yourself; there are none in the Sture family
who have carried themselves in a way to make us turn our
hearts away from them.” Tears came again to the eyes
of Magdalen, but Sigrid was called into an interior room by
her mother. Magdalen went to play with one of her little
nieces, when Lord Eric entered. “Dear lady,” he said,
“would you like to see the horse that I have given you?
It is now waiting in the court.” Magdalen rose and left,
escorted by her cousin. They met two of the women of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
household, whom Eric commanded to follow them. A horse
and sleigh stood in the vaulted entrance. Magdalen was
placed between the two servants, while Eric took his position
back of them on the runners, holding the reins. In the castle
court they met the chaplain and several of the servants, who
thought it a pleasure ride and let them pass. When they
rode down on the frozen lake, the two servants in the sleigh
grasped the importance of the situation for the first time,
and commenced praying Lady Magdalen to return. Lord
Eric silenced them by displaying his short musket. A few
moments later they were surrounded by a force of one hundred
men on horseback, who formed an escort. They were
a loan to Lord Eric by Duke Charles.</p>

<p>The excitement at Hœrningsholm was great when the
elopement was discovered. Margaret Sture happened to
look through the window at the moment when the sleigh
reached the lake. At her outcry Countess Martha and
Sigrid joined her. The old countess fainted on the stairs
when making for the court, and Sigrid was ordered to follow
up the eloping couple. Countess Cecilia found her aunt
on the stairs and hastened to assure her of the mortification
that she felt at the daring and unsuspected deed of her
brother, also expressing some surprise at the bad manner
in which it was accepted. But then the old countess became
wroth, exclaiming: “Go to the devil, and may God
punish both you and your brother! And if you have any
part in his scheme of robbing me of my dear child, betake
yourself after him, so that no shame or dishonor may
happen.” Countess Cecilia hastened to her sleigh and
reached Sværdsbro, where her brother was stopping, ahead
of Sigrid.</p>

<p>When Lady Sigrid arrived at Sværdsbro, she was ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>mitted
through the lines of soldiers only after some difficulty,
finding tailors and seamsters busy cutting and sewing
precious stuffs for clothing for Lady Magdalen and her servants,
“for she left with uncovered head such as she went
and stood in her mother’s house.” Sigrid tried to persuade
her sister to return to her mother, who in her great sorrow
was willing to forgive all if she only came back. Magdalen
sat silent for a long time. Finally she said: “If you can
vouchsafe me, that the lady, my mother, will grant that
we shall belong to each other, since I have so dearly pledged
myself to him, I shall return.” This Sigrid could not do,
and Magdalen added, weeping sorely: “The last complication
is then as bad as the first.” Lord Eric entered with
his sister Cecilia. When Sigrid asked where he intended
to bring Magdalen, he answered: “To Visingsœ, to the
Countess Beatrix, my sister, where she shall remain until we
obtain the consent to marry of the lady, her mother.” It
was arranged that Cecilia should accompany Magdalen, and
Sigrid try her best to win her mother’s consent. Magdalen
sent home to her mother a piece of horn of the fabulous
unicorn; “the only thing I have carried with me from my
father’s house,” she added. This horn, which really was
taken from the incisor of the narwhal, was in those days
generally thought to be authentic and of miraculous power.</p>

<p>Countess Martha was, in her grief and dismay, taken ill.
She soon gathered strength enough to write to King John,
her nephew, pleading her cause. King John at once took
action in the matter, calling Lord Eric to account, and issuing
a command to all ministers of the kingdom, prohibiting
them to unite in marriage the two cousins. Eric Stenbock
was on his way to Stockholm when he received the order
of the king. Upon his arrival at the capital, he was impris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>oned
and deprived of all his offices. But Lord Eric had
powerful friends in Duke Charles and the Stenbock family.
As the king himself did not wish to be without his service,
he was soon set free and reinstalled in his offices. He succeeded
in obtaining the goodwill of the whole Sture family,
but “King Martha” remained irreconcilable. More than
a year had passed since the elopement. One day Lord Eric
suddenly appeared at the castle of Visingsœ. He made,
with Magdalen and his aunt, Lady Anne, a journey into
the province of Halland, where a Danish minister joined the
two cousins in marriage. The wedding was celebrated
at the home of Eric’s father, Baron Gustavus Stenbock
of Torpa. But Lady Magdalen was not happy. She
grieved because of her mother’s hostile attitude, and continued
to dress in black colors, as she had done ever since
she left her mother. Duke Charles, the queen-dowager,
the royal princesses, and all the members of the state council,
yea, the king himself, wrote letters to the indignant
countess, whose ire was rather increased than diminished
thereby.</p>

<p>Finally, after another year and a half, “King Martha”
gave in to the tears and prayers of her daughters. Lady
Magdalen returned to Hœrningsholm after three years of
absence. She was not allowed to come up to the castle
at first, but had to dwell in the building occupied by the
baths. As the winter was approaching, and Lady Magdalen
was soon to give life to a child, her brothers and sisters
prevailed upon their mother to receive Lord Eric and
his wife at the castle. The event was arranged in a conspicuous
way. Countess Martha was seated in the place
of honor in the great hall of the castle, surrounded by her
daughters and sons-in-law, when Lord Eric entered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
Magdalen. When the mother saw her pale and thin features,
she was moved to tears, exclaiming: “Thou unhappy
child!” Magdalen approached her on her knees, and the
countess embraced her, stammering her forgiveness between
tears. Magdalen remained at the castle, where she bore her
husband a son, who was called Gustavus. Lady Martha
invited the king, the duke and the princesses to be present
at the baptism, at the same time granting Magdalen an
equal share of inheritance with the other daughters. Lady
Magdalen continued to dress in mourning as a self-imposed
punishment for her disobedience to her mother. One day
she was preparing to leave for a wedding, when her mother
asked her the reason why she dressed thus. When “King
Martha” learned why, she took a costly cross of diamonds
intended for the bride and placed it on her daughter’s
breast, telling her to put aside her black dresses. From
that day joy and happiness seemed to return to Lady Magdalen,
who commenced to put on lighter colors and to wear
diamonds. Of Magdalen Stenbock&mdash;a child of these Stures,
who so often had protected and preserved Sweden&mdash;Count
Magnus Stenbock was a lineal descendant, he who during
the reign of Charles XII. saved his country in the hour of
its greatest peril and distress.</p>

<p><i>Sigismund</i>, the son and successor of John III., was not
apt to become more popular than his father. Born at the
pleasant prison of Gripsholm, which yet was a prison, he was
of a cold, unsympathetic disposition, a king of few words
and hard to approach. At John’s death, Sigismund was
twenty-six years of age and had reigned several years in
Poland. Charles stepped to the front as the head of the
government until Sigismund’s arrival.</p>

<p>The Protestants, fearing the worst from their new Cath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>olic
king, decided to take firm and early action. The duke
ordered a Riksdag at Upsala in February, 1593, the deliberations
being held by the clergy alone. The Liturgia was
abolished with the majority of Catholic church ceremonies,
Luther’s catechisms, L. Petri’s ritual, church visitations,
etc., being reintroduced. Abraham Angermannus was
elected archbishop, and decision made for the re-establishment
of the Upsala University. The duke had not been
present at the deliberations, and appeared displeased because
not consulted. He, who was secretly accused of being a
Calvinist, pointed out more Catholic ceremonies to be abolished,
whereupon the decisions won the sanction of the duke,
the state council and the bishops. By this act the Lutheran
Church was re-established, the Augsburgian Confession
being laid down by the meeting as its corner-stone. When
this action had been taken, the chairman, Nicolaus Bothniensis,
a young Upsala professor, exclaimed: “Now Sweden
has become <i>one</i> man, and we all have <i>one</i> God.”</p>

<p>In August, 1593, King Sigismund arrived in Sweden,
surrounded by Jesuits and Polish nobles, and with a sum
of money wherewith to pay the expenses of a Catholic
revival. To the demands made to sign the decisions of the
Upsala meeting he gave a flat refusal. The conditions in
Stockholm grew perilous, Jesuits and Lutheran ministers
preaching denouncements upon each other in the churches
and conflicts between the Polish troops and the populace
taking place. In January, 1594, Sigismund, accompanied
by the state councillors and the members of the Riksdag,
came to Upsala for his father’s funeral and his own coronation.
Duke Charles arrived with 3,000 men, whom he quartered
in the neighborhood. He dismissed the papal legate,
Malaspina, and his Jesuits from the funeral procession, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>fore
it entered the cathedral, and told the king, in behalf
of all, that no coronation would take place before the confessional
liberty of the Lutheran Church was confirmed.
The Estates declared themselves ready to sacrifice their lives
for the pure faith. The king still refused his sanction,
whereupon the duke replied that the Riksdag would be dismissed
within twenty-four hours if he insisted. Sigismund
gave in, upon the advice of the Jesuits, who told him that
pledges to Lutherans were not binding. Sigismund was
crowned and returned suddenly to Poland.</p>

<p>The king had left matters in an unsatisfactory condition,
placing six governors with great authority in various districts,
but leaving the government to be conducted by the
duke and the state council in common. This little pleased
the energetic Charles, who soon called a Riksdag at Sœderkœping,
in 1595, forcing the councillors to sanction this act
and follow him to the Riksdag. In Finland, the governor,
Clas Fleming, had tried to have a peace agreement with
Russia postponed as an excuse to keep the navy and army
at his disposal in the interest of the king. At Sœderkœping,
Charles had himself chosen regent, the last vestige
of Catholicism abolished, and the punishment of Fleming
decided on. In consequence, the Catholics were dealt with
in a merciless way through the instigation of the archbishop,
whom the duke called an executioner on account
of his recklessness. The convent of Vadstena was closed,
its eleven nuns scattered and its property confiscated. In
Finland a bloody revolt against the oppression of Fleming
cost 11,000 people their lives. It was called the “War
of Clubs,” on account of the rude weapons used by the
peasants. The state council refused to consent to Fleming’s
punishment, whereupon the duke suddenly resigned. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
he convoked a Riksdag at Arboga, in 1597, at which the
councillors and nobles were absent, also the burghers. The
peasants and clergy were abundantly represented and
cheered the propositions of the duke to the echo. It was
then decided that the king should be asked to return, until
which event the duke was to remain regent, and that peace
should be restored in Finland. Fleming died in the meantime
and was succeeded by Arvid Stolarm, who also was one
of the duke’s enemies. The Riksdag at Arboga was the
first in the deliberations of which the state council had not
taken a part. The councillors were disposed to punish the
duke; but, not agreeing as to means, they left the country
to seek the king.</p>

<p>King Sigismund arrived in the summer of 1598 with an
army of 5,000 Poles, gathering a good deal of strength by
reinforcements from Gothaland. The duke had his stronghold
in Svealand, the Dalecarlians rising to join him. The
Uplanders warded off an attempt made by Stolarm to land
with his army; they were led by Nicolaus Bothniensis, the
Upsala professor, who called his exploit “a crusade.” The
two princes met in East Gothland, near Stegeborg. The
duke and his peasant army were surrounded by the king’s
cavalry, and would have been doomed if not for the outcry
of one of the king’s followers that his subjects would
be killed on either side. The king gave order to stop the
attack, feeling pity at the sight. The duke was deeply
moved by this act and offered to leave the land with his
family. But the deliberations which followed were without
result.</p>

<p>On the 25th of September a battle was fought at
Stongebro, near Linkœping, ending in the defeat of the
royal army. An armistice followed. The conditions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
peace were that the king should remain in Sweden, dismissing
his foreign troops, and take charge of the government.
No one should be punished except five of the nobles, to be
placed before a jury of ambassadors. The king agreed
to the conditions, but soon left Sweden never to return. A
meeting of nobles and clergymen, in 1599, accepted him
as reigning king if willing to return within four months.
In July, a Riksdag was called at Stockholm, which declared
Sigismund dethroned and his son Vladislav king if sent
to Sweden to be educated in the Lutheran faith. Sigismund
took no heed of these stipulations, planning to regain
his throne by force.</p>

<p>Charles followed up the punishment with such unprecedented
severity that it has left a stain upon his memory.
Three nobles were beheaded after Kalmar was taken, and
proceeding to Finland, the duke applied capital punishment
to a wide extent, in more than twenty cases at Abo alone.
At a Riksdag in Linkœping, in 1600, the duke appeared as
an accuser against the five imprisoned nobles and several
others, eight state councillors being among them. The
accused, thirteen in number, were sentenced to death for
high treason, but the majority were pardoned upon confession
of guilt. The councillors Gustavus Banér, Eric Sparre,
Sten Banér and Ture Bielke were beheaded. They were all
men of learning and great ability, who had faithfully served
their king. During John’s reign they had already suffered
years of imprisonment for intrigues against a hereditary
kingdom and a strong government.</p>

<p><i>Charles IX.</i> was chosen king at the bloody Riksdag of
Linkœping, and his son Gustavus Adolphus heir-apparent.
The hereditary rights of Duke John, second son of John
III., were acknowledged, and a duchy, consisting of East<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
Gothland and Leckœ Castle, granted him; but he was
passed over as too young and too closely related to Sigismund.
Measures to strengthen the financial administration
and the army were passed.</p>

<p>Sigismund prepared, by alliances with Catholic powers,
to gather support, Charles turning to England and France
for the same purpose. A conflict was unavoidable, and
Charles decided to invade the disputed province of Livonia,
which he captured, only to be ousted by the Polish general,
Zamoisky. The castle of Volmar was long and heroically
defended by the Swedes under Jacob de la Gardie, a son of
General Pontus, and Charles Gyllenhielm, an illegitimate
son of Charles IX. After their surrender the former received
for five years a tolerable treatment, the latter a most
severe one for twelve years. After attempts to place conditions
on a better footing in Finland, where the peasants
had long suffered through aristocratic oppression, Charles
increased the army still further and invaded Livonia once
more, in 1604. He met with a crushing defeat at Kerkholm,
close by Riga, at the hands of the Pole, Chodkiewitz,
losing 9,000 men. But the Poles did not understand how
to use their victory, and the centre of the conflict changed
to Russia.</p>

<p>On Russian territory, the troops of Sigismund and
Charles were to meet. The line of Rurik became extinct
in 1598, its last descendant, Dimitri, being murdered.
Great complications ensued with usurpers and two “false
Dimitris” in succession. Sigismund supported the false
Dimitris in order to gain ground and place the royal line
of Vasa upon the throne of Russia after that of Rurik.
Charles sided with Vassili Schuisky against the second false
Dimitri. In 1607 an agreement was made that Sweden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
upon the receipt of the province of Kexholm, should send
an army to Russia to support Czar Vassili. In 1609, a
small Swedish army, consisting of Swedes, Finns and some
hired troops, entered Russia, under command of Jacob de
la Gardie. It was received at Novgorod with the blaze
of cannon and tolling of church bells. A victory was won
at Tver over the pretender, but further progress was impeded
by mutiny among the hired troops, the stubborn
Finns returning home. With his 1,200 faithful Swedes,
reinforced by hired troops to 5,000, De la Gardie made a
daring march eastward to Moscow, scaring away the Polish
army, attacking it and making a triumphant entry into the
Russian capital. Sigismund was at Smolensk, and met
De la Gardie at Klusina, winning the battle on account of
renewed mutiny of the hired troops in the Swedish army.
De la Gardie was given free leave with 400 men, upon
pledge not to support Czar Vassili, and later captured the
promised Kexholm, while Sigismund’s son Vladislav for
a short time became czar of Russia.</p>

<p>Although the short reign of Charles IX. was filled with
continual warfare, the king never for a moment lost interest
in the peaceful development of the country. He continued
his father’s work in furthering the mining industry, and
tried to build up the commerce and trade relations. He
founded the city of Gothenburg, on the western coast, in
the island of Hising, opposite Elfsborg, also founding the
towns of Karlstad, Christinehamn, Mariestad and Philipstad.
The aristocracy looked upon his administration with
coldness. It received sanction of the privileges granted by
John III., but nothing more, except in return for additional
<i>russtjenst</i>. The peasants were his favorites and he was
surnamed the “Peasant King.” To the Church, Charles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
stood in a good relation, supporting its re-established Reformation
with his whole authority. Also the University
had in him a patron, although he severely criticised the
too conservative spirit in both, exchanging a series of pamphlets
with the archbishop on theological questions, firm
in his Calvinistic tendencies. To make the government
stronger it was stipulated that four members of the state
council were always to hold the four principal offices, with
the titles of drotsete, kansler (chancellor), admiral and treasurer.
The greatest economy was enforced at court and
throughout the whole system of government, various minor
country offices being established for the enforcement of
order, justice and economy. The king was liberal only
with severe orders and harsh words, the artistic tendencies
of his youth succumbing to the cruel necessities of his
reign.</p>

<p>In private he was as severe as in public life. His first
consort, Maria of the Palatinate-Zweibrucken, had a quieting
influence upon him, but the second, Christine of Holstein,
stern and sharp like the king, strengthened the harshness
and violence of his disposition. During the last years
of his reign, Charles gave his attention to the critical European
situation, desiring to join the Netherlands, England,
France and the Protestant German princes into an alliance
against the forming Catholic league. This man, so assured
of his power to reign and so unscrupulous as to his means,
was very careful not to do any act of importance without
the sanction of his people, and for a long time refused to be
called king. In 1604 he agreed to accept that name, but
was in 1606 ready to cede it to Duke John. Still, after his
coronation he admitted the hereditary right of his nephew,
who was a good-natured man without the qualifications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
of a ruler. At the Riksdag of Norrkœping, in 1604, the
crown was made hereditary among the descendants of
Charles, also in the female line, provided that the monarch
confessed the Lutheran faith and had not accepted the government
of, or residence in, any other country.</p>

<p>The stress placed upon Charles was greater than his
originally strong health could carry. In 1609 he suffered a
stroke of paralysis, which deprived him of his full power of
speech. He still stood firm at the head of the government,
with Prince Gustavus Adolphus, now sixteen years of age,
at his side, who took part in the affairs of State and spoke
for the paralytic king. The young and ambitious Christian
IV. of Denmark thought that the opportune moment was
come to turn down the rising power of Sweden. He declared
war, in April, 1611, in spite of the efforts made by
King Charles to avoid the conflict, pointing to Germany,
where their joined forces would be needed. Christian captured
the town of Kalmar, while its castle withstood his
attacks, being handed over to him by treason. In his wrath
and disgust, Charles sent word to Christian to meet him
in a duel face to face, which the latter refused to do in a
letter of abusive contempt. Gustavus Adolphus had made
a dash into Bleking, capturing the store of provisions at
Christianopel. In the autumn, the war came to a temporary
standstill.</p>

<p>Charles started for Stockholm from Kalmar, but was
taken ill during the journey and died at Nykœping, October
11, 1611, surrounded by his sons and councillors. To his
death-bed came the news that Jacob de la Gardie had captured
the important city of Novgorod, and that the Russians
offered the crown to either of his sons, Gustavus Adolphus
or Charles Philip. With Charles died the only worthy son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
of Gustavus I. Vasa. In strength of intellect and stern
power, he stands first among Swedish rulers. Devoted
to the work of his great father, he educated the Swedish
people, through hardships and sacrifices, to its political
grandeur.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Period of Political Grandeur&mdash;Gustavus II. Adolphus</i></span></h2>

<p>Gustavus II. Adolphus is the greatest figure
of Swedish history, revered and beloved as one of
the noblest of heroes, a genius in whom the qualities
of the great statesman and warrior were blended with
the faith of a man ready to sacrifice his life for the loftiest
of causes&mdash;religious liberty. Gustavus Adolphus was, by
his own triumphant deeds and through his school of discipline,
which turned out men worthy to follow up his work,
destined to bring his country up to the fulfilment of its
mission in the history of human progress, and to open for
it an era of glory and political grandeur which its limited
resources made it impossible to preserve, but which was
fruitful of results for its later cultural evolution.</p>

<p>The secret of Sweden’s success in solving the stupendous
conflict between Catholicism and Protestantism, between
reaction and progress, rested in the fact that this little
country was eminently ready to wage a war for religious
liberty. It had been more perfectly rejuvenated by the
spirit of Protestantism than had, at the time, any other
country. The mediæval state, completed later in Sweden
than on the continent, also gave way there sooner and more
completely than elsewhere. The yeomanry, never fully
suppressed, had preserved its old spirit of independence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
fostered and guided by patriotic leaders of the nobility,
with or without a crown. The population was suffering,
hungering, bleeding, but free, indomitable, and devoted to
its once more hereditary kings of Swedish birth and to
their new faith, which had made strong in them their old
individuality of views and life.</p>

<p>When Gustavus Adolphus ascended the throne, the
country was in the greatest peril and distress, and had
many a lesson to learn before entering the universal conflict
of the Thirty Years’ War.</p>

<p>Gustavus Adolphus was born, Dec. 9, 1594, at the castle
of Stockholm. When six years old, he followed his father
to devastated Finland, returning through Norrland, for the
settlement and future of which territory great plans were
made. At ten, he was ordered to be present at the deliberations
of the state council; at thirteen, he received petitions
and complaints, rectifying wrongs and soothing suffering.
His father said of him, in speaking of the fulfilment
of great works, placing his hand on the curly blond head:
“<i>Ille faciet.</i>” The prince received a severe and carefully
supervised education, led by Johan Skytte. He acquired
knowledge of a considerable number of languages, probably
all in a mechanical way, except the Swedish and German,
with both of which he was made equally and thoroughly
familiar, speaking and writing the latter language with
greater ease and perfection than the emperor Ferdinand,
or Maximilian of Bavaria. In the sciences of economics
and war he was well read, himself inaugurating novel
theories in both. In him the best traits of the Vasa dynasty
were admirably blended and enlarged. He possessed
an acute intellect, far-reaching views of almost prophetic
discernment, a mastery and patience in detail, and an in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>domitable
strength of will. To the ceaseless and painstaking
care of the welfare of his subjects, characteristic
of his father and grandfather, were in him added a harmony
of endowment and a gentleness of disposition which
made him their superior. In him the turbulent blood of
the Vasas was held in noble self-restraint. After his rare
outbursts of passion, he made good his faults in a most
royal manner. His youth was not without the temptations
which beset all richly endowed natures, but they were vanquished
as he grew up to the importance of his grand mission.
He stood in the paternal attitude to his people so
becoming to his grandfather, but lacked the fiery democratic
tendencies and the sympathy for the untitled, unpretentious
and lowly, so strong in his stern father. To his
relatives he was as gentle as to his subjects, treating his
resolute and ambitious mother, Christine of Holstein-Gottorp,
with love and respect; on her demand sacrificing the
love of his youth and intended bride, Ebba Brahe, who
became the consort of victorious Jacob de la Gardie. Also
to his brother Charles Philip he stood in an exemplary
relation; but firmly refused to grant him privileges for his
duchy of Vermland which could be injurious to the country
at large.</p>

<p>Gustavus Adolphus was a man of commanding presence,
tall and of a heavy frame. The color of his face was
clear and light, his eyes blue, his hair and beard blond.
Foreign contemporary authors called him “the golden king
of the North.” He carried his head high, and his open,
frank eye, and the clear voice of manly resonance, gave
added charm to his noble appearance. Gustavus Adolphus
possessed a majestic dignity of bearing coupled with the
unfeigned kindness of a noble heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>Charles IX. had left his son the Danish war as an inheritance.
It was carried on in the provinces of the frontiers,
and consisted chiefly in small conflicts, which caused
fatigue and detriment without being decisive. The Danes
entered the interior of Smaland during the first days of the
year 1612. Gustavus Adolphus, in his turn, moved from
the fort of Ryssby into the province of Scania, destroying
by fire the town of Væ and several castles belonging to the
wealthy nobility. During a smaller conflict which then
took place, Gustavus Adolphus was in imminent danger
of his life.</p>

<p>The Swedes had made a camp for themselves at the
cemetery of Vittsjœ, when suddenly surprised by a force
of Danish cavalry. The Swedes fought with determination,
but found it necessary to leave their camp. They
took a firm stand on the frozen waters of the adjoining lake,
but were forced to leave that position also. A tumult ensued,
during which the ice gave way on the spot where the
king found himself, for the moment, alone and without an
escort. Per Banér, a son of Gustavus Banér, who was
executed at Linkœping at the command of Charles IX.,
perceived the king in the moment of greatest danger, and
hastened with Thomas Larsson, a trooper from Upland,
to rescue him. When in safety, the king at once unbuckled
his silver belt, and, handing it to the trooper, said: “I
shall remember thee with a piece of bread, which neither
thou nor thy children shall ever find lacking.” Thomas
Larsson received in the following year a farm in the province
of Westmanland, which has remained in the possession
of his descendants to this very day. Per Banér received
in fief the estates which had been in the possession of his
uncle, Sten Banér, also executed at Linkœping, and rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
to the dignity of a state councillor during the minority of
Queen Christine.</p>

<p>It was the ambition of Christian IV. of Denmark to cut
Sweden off from any communication with the North Sea.
As Bohuslæn and Halland both were parts of the Danish dominion,
there was only the small strip of territory surrounding
the mouth of the Gotha River to conquer. The island
of Hising constituted the larger part of it, and was the site
of the new town of Gothenburg, which was defended by the
fortress of Elfsborg. The town of New Lœdœse was situated
on the opposite shore, some few miles up the river,
defended by the fort of Gullberg. The Danish king approached
Gullberg from Bohus, having with him a smaller
force, which he considered sufficient in numbers. Gullberg
was only a poor little nest, but it was valiantly defended
by Morten Krakow and his wife, the stanch Lady Emerentia
Pauli. One day the Danes made a violent attack.
The ladders which they placed against the walls were
crushed by heavy beams which the Swedes let fall down
on them. In spite of this, the Danes succeeded in forcing
the gates of the place. The position was a critical one for
the Swedes. The commander had met with an accident
and was unable to lead the defence. But Lady Emerentia
resolved to take the command. She gave orders to the
wives of the soldiers to fill up the vaulted passage of the
gates with barrels, washtubs, timber, etc. When the Danes
stormed on in a compact body, they were received by a
downfall of scalding-hot lye, which the women kept pouring
down on them from behind their barricade. The daughter
of Lady Emerentia thus graphically describes the effect:
“They lay in the vault and around the gates like scalded
hogs.” Lady Emerentia had placed two pieces of artillery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
on the top of a small building fronting the gates. They
were loaded with broken horseshoes and the like and sent
out a disastrous fire. The few surviving Danes fled hurriedly
for their lives, leaving Lady Emerentia in proud
possession of the fort. A second attack which was made
later on proved as futile as the first. King Christian then
gave command to abandon the plan of taking the fort. The
Danish army collected in a field in front of Gullberg. But
Lady Emerentia was vigilant. From the walls of the fort
she espied a man of prepossessing appearance who rode a
white horse. “Shoot that man!” was her immediate command
to the nearest soldier. The shot took effect, killing
the white horse, whose brains and blood spattered the king.
For the man on horseback was King Christian. “That
devilish crow does never sleep!” exclaimed the king, referring
to the commander.</p>

<p>King Christian turned on New Lœdœse, killing without
mercy all the male inhabitants of the town. West Gothland
was invaded, the province appearing to be an easy
prey because the Swedish army, commanded by Duke John,
had just left it to march into Halland. But the bailiff of
Hœjentorp called on the peasants to rise, which caused the
Danes to recede. The Danes next made an attack on the
fortress of Elfsborg, commanded by Olof Strole. Elfsborg
was defended with heroism, but when fire threatened to
destroy the towers, Olof Strole at last surrendered. On
account of their valiant conduct the commander and his
men, who were reduced to 200, were granted free passage
with their music and banners. The able Morten Krakow
of Gullberg had been promoted to the fortress of Vaxholm.
His successor surrendered Gullberg to the Danes shortly
after the fall of Elfsborg. King Christian planned a series<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
of invasions in the year 1612, but, thanks to the vigilance
of Gustavus Adolphus, he failed to accomplish the desired
effect.</p>

<p>Gustavus Adolphus wanted peace with Denmark, and
such was made at Knerœd in 1613, after a war of mutual
invasions and without any decisive battles or conquests of
territory. The frontiers were to remain the same as before
the war; the Danish king was allowed to keep the emblem
of three crowns, but had to resign his claims upon the Swedish
crown. The fortress of Elfsborg remained in the hands
of the Danes for six years, until $1,000,000, an exorbitant
sum in those days, was paid for it. It cost the people of
Sweden very dear to pay this sum, sacrifices being made
by the king and his friends to contribute to it. But Elfsborg,
the only approach to the North Sea, was indispensable.
It was returned in a miserable condition, and Gothenburg,
on the opposite side of Gotha River, destroyed.
Gustavus Adolphus ordered Gothenburg to be moved to its
present site, on the mainland, and endowed it with extensive
commercial privileges, encouraging Dutch merchants
to settle there.</p>

<p>The war with Russia began once more in 1614. Gustavus
Adolphus not having been found willing to accept the
crown for his brother Charles Philip, the negotiations were
dropped. Count de la Gardie resumed control of the movements,
although the king was present in person. The
Swedes won a great victory at Bronitz and captured the
fortress of Augdof. An attempt to take Pskof was unsuccessful,
Evert Horn, the hero of a hundred battles, losing
his life; but the Russians were willing to make peace.
Through the honorable peace of Stolbova, in February,
1617, Russia gave up all claims on Esthonia and Livonia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
and ceded to Sweden Ingermanland and Kexholm. This
cut off the Russians from the Baltic, fixed the Swedish
frontier on the lakes Ladoga and Peipus, and left Sweden
in peace with the mightiest of her enemies during almost a
century. The armistice with Poland ended in 1616, but
after two years of insignificant movements it was continued
up to 1620.</p>

<p>Gustavus II. Adolphus with untiring energy continued
the work of building up the new state founded by Gustavus
I. At the death of his father, the royal youth had won
everybody by his gentleness and generosity. His first act
was perhaps the wisest of all, in selecting among the councillors
the young, highly talented Axel Oxenstierna as his
chancellor. This couple have no peers in history, being
united by the firmest of friendships and rising simultaneously
to the highest ability of statesmanship, the gifts of
the one wonderfully supplementing those of the other. The
chancellor was cooler and slower than his royal friend. He
placed supreme the duties to his country, but was of very
aristocratic tendencies, through his influence leading the
king still further away from the democratic principles of his
father. To the nobility were granted the old privileges,
with others in addition, which became menacing to the
ancient freedom of the peasantry. The management of
internal affairs and all branches of the administration were
placed under various departments. They were presided
over by the high functionaries and their offices chiefly filled
by noblemen. A permanent supreme court was established
in Stockholm, with the Drotsete as president, in 1614. In
1623, a supreme court for Finland was established and a
governor-general for that grandduchy appointed, who was
also to be president of the court. In 1630, a supreme court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
for the Baltic provinces was established at Dorpat. The
Riksdag, governed by the new rules of 1617, was to convene
yearly, and to consist of the four Estates of the kingdom:
the nobility, clergy, bourgeoisie and yeomanry, each divided
into various classes. These latter were as yet not quite
distinct or organized, except those of the nobility, who, in
1625, formed a knightly chapter, the Riddarhus, which kept
a register of the legitimate noble families of Sweden and
Finland and watched over the interests of its members.
The Estate of the nobility was divided in three classes,
lords, knights and squires. To the first belonged the
holders of counties and baronies, to the second those whose
ancestors held the rank of state councillors, and to the third
the rest of the nobility. As each class had one vote in the
Riksdag, the supremacy of lords and knights, called the
“higher nobility,” was secure, when standing united, over
the more numerous third class, the “lower nobility.” The
king appointed the speaker of the nobility, the <i>landtmarskalk</i>,
who also was the president of their chapter. The
Swedish church had its greatest epoch during the period
of political grandeur, being characterized by a remarkable
strength of faith and by a praiseworthy energy and earnestness.
The clergy, high and low, set beautiful examples of
piety, learning and patriotism. It was beloved by the people
and spoke in their behalf with authority and courage.
Not able to win Gustavus Adolphus over to more democratic
views, it won his admiration, and he surnamed the
ministers “tribunes of the people.” The burghers, touched
by the patriotic spirit, developed great energy during this
period, trade and commerce having a devoted patron in
the king, who, besides the new Gothenburg, founded twelve
other towns in Sweden and Finland. The miners occupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
of old an uncertain position between burghers and yeomen.
They were strengthened and encouraged by the personal
interest which the king took in the mining industry. He
visited the mines repeatedly, descending into the bowels
of the earth to inspect the ore and the new methods introduced
from abroad by foreign miners. Among the latter
the immigrated Dutchman, Louis de Geer, exerted a beneficial
influence upon that industry. The factories producing
clothing and weapons for the army were also encouraged.
The yeomen occupied a difficult, almost desperate position
between the increasing privileges of the nobility and the increasing
taxes of the crown. Their burdens were doubled
and their rights reduced; yet sustained by the church, and
believing in the lofty ideals of the king, they persevered,
fulfilling their duties with a high degree of patriotism.</p>

<p>No Swedish king has done so much for education as
Gustavus Adolphus. To the University of Upsala he donated
300 of his hereditary estates, founding its library,
improving its courses, banishing misrule, and appointing
his old teacher, John Skytte, its chancellor. He
created the German University of Dorpat in Esthonia, in
1632; later for some time moved to Pernau. Colleges were
established in the larger towns. The king was, through
his thorough studies of Swedish laws and conditions, in a
position to take an active part in the reforms which he
promulgated, never resting long in one place, but travelling
from one point to another, where his presence was
most necessary; shaping plans and reforms by his own
judgment, to have them indorsed by the next Riksdag,
and then enforcing them himself. Especially the army
passed through an evolution, thanks to new methods, devised
by the king, who was to win his victories through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
the introduction of improved tactics and divisions, by means
of which the troops were easier to move and the co-operation
between the various weapons increased.</p>

<p>In 1618 the “Thirty Years’ War” began. The dethroned
Frederic of the Palatinate turned, among others,
to Gustavus Adolphus for support, which the latter was
not able to give in a direct way. But he promised to attack
Poland as soon as the armistice was at an end, thereby
making it impossible for Sigismund to support Emperor
Ferdinand with troops. In 1621, Gustavus Adolphus commenced
operations against Poland, taking the command
himself. Riga and Mitau were captured, the former important
commercial centre regaining its privileges, but sending
representatives to the Swedish Riksdag and accepting
a Swedish governor. After having conquered Livonia,
Gustavus Adolphus entered Courland the following year,
when an armistice was agreed to. Gustavus followed the
events in Germany with increasing interest, forming the
plan of an alliance between the Protestant powers. Learning
that the emperor was willing to support Sigismund,
Gustavus Adolphus offered to invade Silesia. But as Christian
IV. of Denmark was anxious to lead the Protestant
forces, Gustavus Adolphus quietly withdrew, resuming
action against Poland. After a victory at Wallhof, he
entered Polish Prussia, where he was dangerously wounded
at Dirschau. The Poles were reinforced by imperial troops,
but suffered a defeat at Gurzo; the Swedish general, Herman
Wrangel, winning the day. When the considerable
reinforcements of 10,000 men joined the Poles, the Swedes
receded in good order. A smaller conflict occurred at
Stuhm, famous because Gustavus Adolphus was twice in
danger of his life during the struggle, which otherwise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
was of no importance. An imperial trooper caught him
by the belt and tried to drag the king with him. According
to the report of Axel Oxenstierna, the king loosened
the belt and let it go. In so doing, he also lost his hat,
which was carried to Vienna and preserved as a token of
the “great victory.” Another trooper, shortly afterward,
caught the king by the arm, aiming at the head with his
sword. In the critical moment, Eric Soop, the colonel of
a Swedish cavalry regiment, appeared, killing the trooper
with a pistol-shot. Gustavus Adolphus referred to this
struggle as the “hottest bath” that he was ever in.</p>

<p>In September, 1629, an armistice was agreed to, at
Altmark, to last for six years, during which period Sweden
was to keep Livonia and the Russian towns of Elbing,
Braunsberg, Pillau and Memel. The new acquisition of
territory was small, but the revenue from these commercial
towns, and from Dantzic, Libau and Windau, was considerable,
and went to pay for the army expenses of the German
campaign. The new temporary possessions in Prussia
were formed into a Swedish governmental section, over
which Axel Oxenstierna was appointed governor-general.</p>

<p>What follows belongs to one of the most noted chapters
of universal history. The unbroken chain of Swedish victories,
the noble character of the king and the severe discipline
upheld among his men, who commenced and ended
their battles with prayers and hymns, astounded the world.
The exalted nobility of Gustavus Adolphus appears to us
all the more striking, contrasted with the faithlessness,
vanity and cowardice of the contemporary reigning princes
of Germany and Denmark. His victories appear all the
more remarkable because the greatest warriors of the age&mdash;Tilly,
Wallenstein and Pappenheim&mdash;were his adversaries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
He was received by the people of Germany as a liberator,
and his memory is blessed by every thinking German, who
admits that the Swedes, Gustavus Adolphus and Axel Oxenstierna,
completed the work which the Germans, Luther
and Melanchthon, created. The loftiness of the ideals
which inspired Gustavus Adolphus have been doubted,
but not with justice. He was brought up in a severely
Christian home and the sincerity of his piety is unmistakable.
His father’s clairvoyant views upon the coming
religious conflict were familiar to him since his early youth,
while he was, through his mother, related in blood to the
majority of Protestant princes. Thus apparently predestined,
as the greatest statesman and warrior of his age, to
take up the cause of his persecuted brethren, he did not do
so before the ambitious Christian IV. had utterly failed
in his attempts and with contumely been forced to retire.
It is not probable that Gustavus Adolphus ever thought
of placing the crown of the Roman empire upon his head,
but plausible to suppose that he had in view the formation
of a strong union of the Protestant countries of Northern
Europe.</p>

<p>Before leaving Sweden, Gustavus II. convoked the representatives
of his people, holding on his arm his little
daughter Christine, four years old, for whom he asked their
pledge of allegiance. His farewell speech was touching
in its simplicity and the premonition of his tragic end.
Not for worldly glory, but to save his country from peril
and his brethren from distress, he undertook this risky war.
“Generally,” he said, “it happens thus that the vessel hauls
water until it goes to pieces. With me likewise, that I,
who in so many perils for the weal of my country have
shed my blood, and yet until this day have been spared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
through the grace of God, now at last must lose my life.
For that reason I will this time commend you, the collected
Estates of the realm, to the hand of God, the Supreme One,
wishing that we, after this our miserable and burdensome
life, according to the will of God, may meet again, to dwell
in the celestial and infinite.” These words do not resemble
the terse, striking speeches of his grandfather, but they bear
the stamp of sincerity, and by them Gustavus Adolphus,
his work and his purpose, are judged by the Swedish
people.</p>

<p>Midsummer Day, 1630, Gustavus Adolphus landed with
his troops at the island of Ruden, on the coast of Pomerania.
Two days later he proceeded to the larger island
of Usedom. His troops consisted of 13,000 men. Gustavus
Adolphus was himself the first to land. He knelt on the
shore and prayed to God in a loud voice; his prayer moved
those surrounding him to tears. When the king noticed
it he said: “Do not cry, but pray to God with fervor.
The more of prayer, the more of victory; the best Christian
is the best soldier.” Then he took hold of a spade and
commenced to assist personally in the work of building a
camp. When it grew dark, the heavens were illuminated
by the fire of burning villages, giving evidence of the manner
in which the enemy conducted his warfare.</p>

<p>The supercilious Wallenstein had been dismissed by the
emperor at the time when Gustavus Adolphus landed in
Germany, but his wild hordes were pillaging Pomerania.
Yet Gustavus Adolphus had great difficulty in persuading
the old duke of Pomerania to accept the alliance he offered
him. But when this was done, it took the Swedes only a
short time to clear the duchy of its enemies. The young
landgrave of Hesse and the free city of Magdeburg were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
glad to accept an alliance with Gustavus Adolphus. A
treaty was made with France, which country promised to
pay subsidies to Sweden as long as the German war lasted.
Tilly, who was in command of the imperial troops, approached
Magdeburg. Gustavus Adolphus sent proper
provisions to Magdeburg with an experienced commander,
as he could not go himself, because the elector of Saxony
refused to let him pass with his army through Saxon territory.
Magdeburg was captured by Tilly, who sacked and
destroyed it by fire in a most barbarous way.</p>

<p>The discipline and moderation of the Swedish troops
formed a great contrast to the reckless behavior of the imperial
army. The Swedes left the peaceful inhabitants
in undisturbed possession of their lives and property; the
strictest order was maintained within the army; each regiment
held morning and evening prayers in the open air;
gambling, carousing and plundering were sternly prohibited.
For these reasons the Swedish king and his army
were received by the poor downtrodden people as saviors
and liberators. Gustavus Adolphus deeply mourned the
fall of Magdeburg, whose fate it had not been in his power
to prevent. He took a fortified position at Werben, where
the river Havel is joined by the Ube. Tilly entered Saxony
with a hostile demeanor, not satisfied with the lukewarm
friendship of the elector. Burning villages marked the way
of his army. The poor elector, not knowing what to do, in
his despair turned to Gustavus Adolphus, whom he had
treated so coldly and begged him for help. The king at
once was ready to forget past differences, and, joining
forces with the elector, he marched toward Leipsic.</p>

<p>Tilly, with 35,000 men, occupied an advantageous position
near the village of Breitenfeld, not far from Leipsic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
at the summit of a long ridge of sandy hills. The infantry
and the greater part of the cavalry were grouped in heavy
divisions, forming one single line of battle with artillery
behind at the very top of the hills. Tilly himself commanded
the centre, while his able and fiery sub-commander,
Pappenheim, had the command of the left wing, being in
hopes to encounter the Swedish king personally. The
Swedish army consisted of 22,000 men, who were joined
by 11,000 Saxons.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of September 7, 1631, the Swedes
started toward Breitenfeld. Tilly turned pale, it is said,
when he saw the order and firmness with which the Swedes
marched up to take their positions on the narrow slips of
ground between the Lober brook and the reach of the imperial
cannon. The Swedes were arranged in a double line
of battle, infantry in the centre and cavalry on the wings.
Between the squadrons of cavalry divisions of musketeers
were placed. The regimental artillery was distributed over
a number of places. The king commanded the right wing
in person, with John Banér as sub-commander. Teuffel
led the centre and Gustavus Horn the left wing. The king
had no confidence in the Saxons, for which reason he had
arranged them by themselves at some distance to the left
of the Swedish army. When everything was arranged, the
king rode to the front. With his head uncovered, and his
sword pointing to the ground, he prayed: “Almighty God,
thou who holdest victory and defeat in the hollow of thy
hand, turn thine eyes unto us, thy servants, who have come
hither from distant dwellings to fight for liberty and truth,
for thy holy Gospel. Give victory unto us for the glory
of thy hallowed name! Amen!” The prayer of the king
could be heard by almost every man of the army, and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
were touched and strengthened by his pious trust in a righteous
cause. The Swedes of the right wing were soon attacked
by Pappenheim and his cavalry. But the horses
of the imperialists were frightened by the flashing fire of
the musketeers, and the attack failed to have an effect.
It was ended as quickly as it was begun. Pappenheim
concluded to make an attempt to surprise the Swedes from
the left side. But the king divined his plan. He ordered
John Banér with the second line to make a movement by
which to turn at an angle with the first and face the attack
from the side. Pappenheim was surprised to find a new
line facing him. A bloody struggle ensued. Seven times
his men made an inroad on the Swedish line and were seven
times repulsed, badly damaged by the fire of the musketeers.
The Swedes, in their turn, made an attack which
scattered Pappenheim’s forces from the field in wild flight.</p>

<p>Tilly had with his light cavalry attacked the left wing
of the Swedes. His men were mostly made up of Croats
and other semi-barbarous people. When repulsed by the
Swedes they concentrated their forces to crush the Saxons.
These withstood the first assault, but the second routed
them completely. The imperialists then made a second
attack upon the left Swedish wing, made up of only 2,500
men. Gustavus Horn acted with coolness and great presence
of mind. He let the first line close in on the second
till it was able to take a firm stand against the heavy force
of the attacking enemy. The Swedes never for a moment
lost their position, in spite of the frightful onslaught. The
king arrived and remained for some time with the left wing.
He ordered the Scotch brigade of hired troops to support
him. The Scotch had cannon hidden behind their lines.
These had a telling effect upon the attacking imperialists,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
who were thrown back, suffering great losses. Everywhere
the battle was fought with frenzy, the clouds of dust and
smoke changing the day into night.</p>

<p>The king made sure that the left wing of the enemy’s
army was engaged in continued flight. Then he commenced
an attack with his own right wing upon the imperial
artillery, which had kept up a steady fire against the
Swedish centre. Tilly’s cannon were captured at the first
attempt and turned on the imperial troops, causing consternation.
Horn opened an attack on his side and the
king hastened to support him with his troops. Tilly tried
in vain to lead his troops into the battle. Pappenheim had
returned and gave brilliant proofs of personal courage. The
defeat of the imperial army was unavoidable; it scattered
in helpless confusion. Tilly lost his horse and was near
being captured himself. Four of his best infantry regiments
took a stand and tried to resist the conquering foe.
These imperial soldiers, who never had suffered a defeat,
preferred death to surrender. Tilly fled at last, followed by
only 600 men. After five hours of fighting the Swedes had
won a glorious victory. They finished the day with prayer
and remained on the battlefield over night, arranged in
order of battle. The following morning they entered the
deserted camp of the enemy where a rich booty awaited
them.</p>

<p>The progress of Gustavus Adolphus along the shores
of the river Main to the towns of Frankfort and Mayence
was a march of triumph. In capturing Mayence, the
Swedes fought the Spanish allies of the emperor. The
towns surrendered to violence or by their own consent.
Gustavus Adolphus made their inhabitants pledge their
fidelity to him and strengthened his power with the rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
resources of the Frankish country. Then he turned against
Maximilian of Bavaria. Tilly, who was to defend Bavaria,
was again encountered and defeated at Lech. He was carried
from the battle mortally wounded and died soon afterward.
Gustavus Adolphus made his triumphal entry into
Munich, with Frederic of the Palatinate at his side. The
danger to the crown lands of the emperor was imminent.</p>

<p>Wallenstein was the most famous of German generals.
Reticent and secretive, he appeared to be unable to feel
mercy. He was devoted to the secret doctrines of astrology,
which in him had taken the place of religion. He
cared naught for the cause of religious liberty or the fall
of the German empire, looking only for occasions to satisfy
his own ambition and the means of obtaining power
and wealth. He had served the emperor, who had raised
him to the dignity of a duke of Mecklenburg, but had been
dismissed and deprived of his dignities at the time of the
arrival of Gustavus Adolphus on German soil. His downfall
was caused by complaints of his insolence and recklessness,
made by Maximilian of Bavaria and other German
princes. Wallenstein retired to Prague, at the castle of
which town he surrounded himself with princely luxury
and comfort, scheming for revenge. His plan was to join
the enemies of the emperor. He approached Gustavus
Adolphus for such purpose, before the battle of Breitenfeld,
and was delighted to hear of the defeat of Tilly. Gustavus
Adolphus seemed at first inclined to take up relations with
Wallenstein, but at the point where an agreement was to
be made he suddenly changed his attitude. The king probably
hesitated to accept the services of a man who had no
other aim than to satisfy his own ambition. The emperor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
was placed in a bad predicament, at the second defeat of
Tilly, for want of an army to defend his lands and a commander
to lead it. There was only one way out of the
difficulty, and that was to pacify the mortally offended
Wallenstein, and to persuade him to re-enter the service
of the emperor. The emperor resigned himself to accept
this humiliating condition, and Wallenstein agreed to resume
command, but only at a high price. The name of
Wallenstein was enough to bring thousands of warriors
under the imperial banners, and Wallenstein was soon at
the head of an army of sufficient proportions. His doctrine
was that “the war should support itself,” according to
which his soldiers were allowed to sack and plunder at will
the countries through which they were passing. He cared
naught for the recklessness of his subordinates, if they only
showed blind obedience to him.</p>

<p>Wallenstein expelled the Saxons who had invaded Bohemia.
But he showed disinclination to assist the elector
of Bavaria, who was compelled to leave his country. At
Eger, Wallenstein was reinforced and marched on Nuremberg
with an army of 60,000, prepared to meet Gustavus
Adolphus. He was confident of his superior force. “Within
four days,” he said, “it shall become evident whether
I or the Swedish king is the master of Germany.” Gustavus
Adolphus hastened to relieve Nuremberg, taking his
position in the immediate neighborhood of said town. He
had only 18,000 men with him, but he surrounded this army
with solid fortifications, and Wallenstein dared not risk an
attack, in spite of his superior force. Wallenstein took his
position at the summit of three steep hills, surrounded by
trenches and ramparts. His intention was to cut off the
Swedes from all sources of supplies and force them to sur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>render
by starvation. “I shall teach the Swedish king,”
he said, “a new method of warfare.”</p>

<p>For nine weeks the two armies were facing each other.
The suffering became great in both camps. The Swedes
suffered most, although the inhabitants of Nuremberg tried
their utmost to supply them with food. When the provisions
were diminishing, the bonds of discipline were loosened.
Especially the Germans of the Swedish army made themselves
conspicuous by licentiousness and plunder. Gustavus
Adolphus decided to try an attack on Wallenstein’s
camp, in order to put an end to the critical state of things.
He was so much more anxious to risk it, as his army had
been considerably reinforced and was almost equal to Wallenstein’s
in numbers. At noon, August 24, 1632, the
Swedish army made ready for battle. The attack was first
made on Burgstall, the most important one of the three
hills occupied by the enemy. The battle was a fierce and
bloody one, the whole mountain being clothed in fire and
smoke. Several of the most distinguished of the Swedish
officers were killed or captured. A bullet passed through
the boot of the king; an officer was killed at his side. The
Swedes were thrown back on one hand, while on the other,
Duke Bernhard of Weimar, one of the German commanders
of the king, succeeded in capturing one of the forts built on
the Burgstall. But as the day was over and the army
exhausted, the Swedes were not able to profit by their success.
A heavy rain commenced, continuing through the
night. This made it impossible to haul any cannon up to
the captured fort, which was then abandoned. The Swedish
army returned to the camp. This unsuccessful attack
cost the Swedes almost 2,000 men. Gustavus Adolphus
wrote in regard to it: “It was too much to be considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
a page’s trick, but too small to be of real earnest.” Wallenstein
wrote of it. “Never in my life have I seen a more
desperate fire, but I hope that the Swedes have lost their
horns in this conflict.”</p>

<p>The king broke camp a fortnight later, arranging his
army into a line of battle. For four hours he waited for
Wallenstein to come forward, but the latter did not risk
an attack. Gustavus Adolphus intended to enter Swabia,
to complete the conquest of Southwestern Germany. But
Wallenstein, who soon afterward also broke camp, invaded
Saxony. This caused the king to change his plans. He
was obliged to follow Wallenstein in order to protect his ally
and to avoid the danger of being cut off from the connections
with his own empire. Wallenstein marked his way
by cruel devastation, and the appeals of the unhappy population
persuaded the king to take an early decision.</p>

<p>The people of Saxony received Gustavus Adolphus with
great enthusiasm, of which they gave evidence in the most
exultant manner. People were seen kneeling everywhere
on his way, imploringly stretching their hands toward him.
The king was not content with their exaggerated devotion.
“I fear that God is offended by their vain demonstrations
of joy and soon shall show them that the one whom they
adore as a god is naught but a weak and mortal man.”</p>

<p>Wallenstein was in the neighborhood of Leipsic, at the
little town of Lutzen. He had sent away Pappenheim, his
best sub-commander, to Halle with a considerable force.
Gustavus Adolphus found this circumstance favorable and
decided on an attack.</p>

<p>It was the 6th of November, 1632. A heavy mist covered
the spacious fields around Leipsic. Wallenstein was,
with the right wing of his army, close on Lutzen, the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
town being set on fire, in order not to shield a clandestine
attack. The flame of the conflagration appeared dull but
magnified through the mists of the early morning. In
front of the imperial army was the highway. Musketeers
were stationed in and above the ditches, which were made
deeper and provided with ramparts. The musketeers were
so arranged that higher lines could shoot over the heads of
the lower ones. Behind them was another chain of musketeers.
The artillery was placed partly behind the musketeers,
partly on the sides of a hill where some windmills
were situated. The cavalry was placed on the wings, the
infantry in the centre, both arranged in great square divisions.
A courier had been sent to recall Pappenheim, as the
army without his force counted only 18,000 men. The
Swedish army was 20,000 strong and was arranged according
to a plan similar to the one followed at Breitenfeld. It
was arranged in two lines. Musketeers were interspersed
among the cavalry. The regimental artillery was placed
before the front. The king commanded the right wing,
Nils Brahe the centre, Kniephausen the second line of the
centre, and Duke Bernhard the left wing.</p>

<p>The king, who for the time being had none of his best
officers around him, spent the night in a wagon, together
with Duke Bernhard and Kniephausen. He rose in the
morning, dressed, without armor, in a blouse and a gray
coat, and mounted his usual white charger, without having
tasted food. He conducted in person the morning prayers
of the army, when Luther’s psalm, “Eine feste Burg ist
unser Gott,” was sung. After the song had ceased, the
king made a short speech in Swedish, which he repeated in
German. He said: “There you have the enemy. He is
not now at the top of the hill or behind intrenchments, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
in the open field. You know well how eagerly he has
sought to avoid a conflict and that he is forced to fight
because he cannot escape us. Fight, then, my dear countrymen
and friends, for God, your country and your king. I
will reward you all. But if you flinch, you know well that
not a man of you will ever see his country again.” Then
the psalm, “Versage nicht du Hæuflein klein,” the words
of which were written in German by Gustavus Adolphus
himself, was sung. The king gave the sign of attack by
waving his sword over his head and cried: “Forward in
God’s name; Jesu, Jesu, Jesu, help us to-day to strive
to the honor of thy holy name!”</p>

<p>It was eleven o’clock, and the mists had, to a great
extent, scattered. The Swedish centre, with the battery
behind, marched toward the highway. The left wing made
an attempt to penetrate between the burning Lutzen and
the batteries below the windmills. A terrible fire from
muskets and cannon met the attacking Swedes. Whole
lines of infantry were killed. The left wing suffered in
particular. But when the Swedes reached their destination,
the centre moved on with great force, cleaning the
ditches of musketeers, capturing seven pieces of artillery
and making two of the great squares of imperial infantry
retire from their position. While fighting the third, the
Swedes were surprised by the reserve and cavalry forces
of the enemy, and had to abandon what they had taken,
retiring into the open field.</p>

<p>The king had, in the meantime, with the cavalry of the
right wing, forced the ditches. When notified of the danger
in which the centre was placed, he hurried to assist his
infantry. At the head of his Smaland cavalry he moved
on so quickly that he was separated from the rest of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
forces. The king was near-sighted and the mist once more
thickening. For these reasons he happened to ride close
up to the lines of the imperial cuirassiers. His horse was
wounded, and the king himself received a pistol shot in the
arm. He turned to one of his companions, Duke Frantz
Albrecht, of Sachsen-Lauenburg, with a request to be escorted
out of the battle, but was at that instant wounded
in the back, immediately falling off his horse. Duke Frantz
Albrecht, only thinking of saving his own life, fled from the
spot. But a German page, eighteen years of age, who accompanied
the king, jumped from his horse and tried to
assist the king in mounting it. Some imperial cavalrymen
passed by. They inquired for the name of the wounded
lord. The page tried to hide his identity, but Gustavus
Adolphus answered: “I was once the king of Sweden.”
One of the imperialists attempted to drag the king with
him, but seeing some Swedish soldiers approaching, he sent
in leaving a bullet through the wounded hero’s brain.</p>

<p>The Swedes had been thrown back from the highway
all over the line. The white horse of the king, with empty
saddle and stained with blood, was seen galloping before
the front. The message of mourning spread with lightning
rapidity through the army, causing universal sorrow and
anger. The ambition to avenge the death of the beloved
king was kindled in every breast. Duke Bernhard at once
assumed supreme command when notified of the catastrophe.
The sagacious Kniephausen thought the battle lost
and considered it best to retire in good order. The duke
answered: “Here is not the question of retreat, but of revenge
in victory or death.” The Swedish line of battle
soon moved forward once more and with redoubled strength.
The right wing, commanded by the valiant Stolhandske,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
threw back the imperial troops who had caused the fall
of the king. Nils Brahe once more carried the troops of the
centre across the highway and captured for a second time
the seven pieces of artillery. The left wing, commanded
by Duke Bernhard, also moved forward victoriously, capturing
the batteries at the windmill and pointing the cannon
toward the enemy. When simultaneously some wagons
loaded with powder for the imperial artillery exploded with
a tremendous roar, the whole army of Wallenstein was
thrown into a state of confusion. It was thought that the
Swedes had made an attack from the rear. The cavalry
fled in great numbers with the cries: “We know the king
of Sweden! He is worst toward the end of the day.”</p>

<p>But now another cry was heard: “Pappenheim is coming!
Pappenheim is coming!” And so it was. Pappenheim
arrived with his valiant cavalry at this important
juncture. “Where is the king of Sweden to be found?”
was his first question. When told that Gustavus Adolphus
had been seen leading the right wing, he hurried thither,
not knowing the fate that had befallen his royal enemy,
and desirous of fighting him face to face. The imperialists
recommenced the battle with renewed vigor. The scattered
forces of cavalry and infantry were collected once more and
were joined by the fresh troops of Pappenheim. The attacking
Swedes met a stanch resistance. The latter were
almost tired out, but preserved their courage. A contemporary
writer says that a battle was never fought in a better
way by troops who had for such a long stretch been in
the fire. The Swedish losses were exceedingly heavy. The
royal standard and several other banners were taken. The
able Nils Brahe was killed, and the division of which he
was the head fell to the very last man. But Pappenheim,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
who rushed forward blindly, in his eagerness to meet the
king of Sweden, was also killed, according to tradition,
by a bullet from Stolhandske. “Pappenheim has fallen!
All is lost!” shouted his men, and drew back discouraged.
Wallenstein still thought there was a chance to hold the
field against the exhausted enemy.</p>

<p>Kniephausen had preserved the second line of battle in
good order, resolved to cover the retreat he thought unavoidable.
He had sent away smaller divisions to support
the first line, but not in numbers enough to disturb the
order of his own troops. Now he commanded his men to
the front, to fill all the gaps of the first lines. When this
was done, the Swedes made a third attack. The evening
sun pierced through the mists for a moment, and Wallenstein
in this light saw the Swedish army approach in a
mighty solid line as at the opening of the battle. He was
greatly surprised. This time the Swedes were resolved to
conquer or die. Soldiers were heard to promise each other
to stand by that resolution. For a third time the Swedes
passed the highway and recaptured, after a bloody struggle,
the disputed cannon. The wings of Wallenstein’s army
were both in a state of dissolution. But his centre preserved
two divisions which offered a stubborn resistance
until sunset, when they were ordered to retreat. The
Swedes had won the day, but were too tired to pursue the
enemy. Following their custom, they rested over the night
on the battlefield they had bought by their blood.</p>

<p>The loss of troops had been heavy on either side,
amounting to about 6,000 men altogether, or about one-third
of the whole number of men engaged in the battle.
The excitement was so great on both sides that no prisoners
were made. The corpse of Gustavus Adolphus, bruised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
and mangled, was found during the night under a heap of
dead soldiers. A large monumental stone, with inscription,
now marks the spot where the hero king lost his life. The
Gustavus Adolphus Society of Germany is a living monument
to his memory.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Period of Political Grandeur&mdash;Queen Christine</i></span></h2>

<p>Christine was six years old when she succeeded
her father. Her armies stood scattered through
foreign lands, surrounded by enemies and faithless
allies. Her country was covered with glory, but in direst
distress. The most remarkable aspect of her father’s greatness
now was to become apparent. Gustavus Adolphus had
left behind men whom he had educated as statesmen, and
generals capable of bringing his work to a successful end.
First among the former was the state chancellor, <i>Axel
Oxenstierna</i>, the friend and adviser of the hero king. He
managed to keep the Swedish allies together and to establish
harmony and unity of action between the Swedish commanders,
supplying funds to carry on the war and strengthening
the government at home with his courage and his
wisdom. Oxenstierna was a statesman of considerable
power before the death of the king; after it he grows in
grandeur to carry the burden of unlimited responsibility
placed on his shoulders. His coolness and dignity were
a source of constant irritation to Richelieu, who said there
was “something Gothic and a good deal of Finnish” about
his proceedings in diplomatic affairs, while Mazarin said
that if all the statesmen of his time were to be put aboard
of one vessel, Oxenstierna should be placed at the helm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
The great chancellor always upheld the dignity of his country.
When French diplomatists forgot themselves thus far
as to use, in correspondence, their own language, instead of
Latin, the recognized language of diplomacy in that day,
Axel Oxenstierna gave instructions that they should be
answered in Swedish.</p>

<p>After the death of Gustavus Adolphus, the war in Germany
lost more and more of its original aspect. The cause
of Protestantism was dropped out of sight for political interests.
The battles of Sweden were, to a great extent, and
sometimes altogether, fought by foreign troops; but Swedish
were the generals and statesmen who led the operations
of the armies and the diplomatic deliberations. The success
of Sweden, at first, seemed to have passed away with her
great hero king. The imperialists won a great victory at
Nœrdlingen in 1634. The young archduke, Ferdinand, had
succeeded Wallenstein as their commander-general, the latter
having been murdered at the request of the emperor.
Ferdinand marched on the town of Nœrdlingen with an
army of German and Spanish troops, the experienced Piccolomini
being at his side. Duke Bernhard, who with an
army had been taking possession of Franconia in his own
personal interests, hastened to support the town and was
joined by Gustavus Horn, who, with another army, had
been stationed in Elsass. Count Horn gave the advice to
await reinforcements, but the excitable Duke Bernhard
opened an attack on the enemy, which necessitated an immediate
battle. After eight hours of hard fighting, the imperialists,
who were 30,000 strong, entirely routed the
Swedish army of 18,000 men, not a single Swedish regiment
being among them. Horn was made a prisoner.
Duke Bernhard, who soon afterward with his troops entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
French service, acknowledged his fault, saying: “I was
a fool, but Horn a wise man.” Sweden lost through this
terrible defeat an army and two able generals. The Swedish
conquests in South Germany were lost, and the German
allies were scattered, the elector of Saxony joining the cause
of the emperor. The armistice with Poland came to an end
in 1635, and it was renewed for twenty-six years, at the
cost of the Prussian seaports, with their lucrative revenues,
which had paid for the expenses of the German war. Oxenstierna
returned to Sweden to gather means wherewith
to continue the war. The ordinary resources of Sweden
were drained, and great sacrifices were needed. The
Riksdag declared itself willing to “risk life, blood and
means, until God grants a peace equal to the dignity of
Sweden.”</p>

<p>John Banér was the man who re-established the success
of the Swedish arms. He resembled Gustavus Adolphus
in greatness of mind and ability in war, paying back the
execution of his father under Charles IX., by loyalty to
the illustrious son of the latter. Banér was a typical soldier
of the Thirty Years’ War, amiable, but licentious, and cruel
to his enemies. An able tactician and strategist of inexhaustible
resources, he had distinguished himself in the
Polish war and later held many important commands. The
death of Gustavus Adolphus stirred this strong man to the
very depths of his soul. He left his army in Bavaria and
arrived at Wolgast, resolved to leave the army. At the
sight of the body of his beloved king, he was overcome by
a paroxysm of grief. Axel Oxenstierna persuaded him to
resume his command in order to bring the work of their
dead master to completion. He marched with his army
through Silesia to Bohemia, encamping before Prague.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
After the battle of Nœrdlingen he retreated to Saxony,
whose deceitful elector he reproached with harsh words.
Intrigues by the latter to bring the German troops in Swedish
service to mutiny were frustrated by Banér, who had
only 2,000 Swedes and Livonians with him. The Saxon
army followed Banér into Mecklenburg, but suffered a defeat
at Dœmitz. Banér marched eastward and joined the
Swedish force, which met him, from Prussia, commanded
by Lennart Torstensson. The elector of Brandenburg also
declared war on Sweden, Banér answering by invading his
country. From the vicinity of Berlin, Banér continued his
way through Saxony back to Mecklenburg, his German
troops marauding with such cruelty that they were sharply
remonstrated with by Banér, who said he found it strange
that God did not instantly punish them.</p>

<p>Banér was followed by the united armies of Austria and
Saxony, but, having received reinforcements of Swedish
troops, he turned on his tracks and met the enemy at Wittstock,
in Brandenburg, September 24, 1636. The Swedish
army consisted of 20,000 men, while the opposing force was
much larger and occupied a favorable position on a hill.
Banér won a glorious victory, thanks to a skilfully executed
manœuvre. It grew dark, and the right wing of the
Swedes was leading an almost forlorn hope against the
overwhelming forces, when their left wing, after a difficult
roundabout move, attacked the enemy from behind. Of
the hostile armies every man was killed except a detachment
less than 1,000 strong. The baggage, artillery and
banners were taken, even the table silver of the elector and
the imperial generals falling into the hands of the Swedes,
who by this victory had regained their supremacy on German
soil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>Banér had commenced the siege of Leipsic, when, upon
news of an approaching army of the imperial allies, he was
forced to undertake the famous “Retreat from Torgau,”
which made him more celebrated than any of his great battles.
He with his army was near being surrounded at the
river Oder, but saved himself through a series of movements
of the highest strategic skill. Cardinal Richelieu wrote that
“this retreat, by means of which Banér saved 14,000 men,
less a few fugitives and wounded, with cannon and baggage,
against an army 60,000 strong, is to be compared to the most
glorious deeds in history.” The enemy prided itself on having
“caught Banér in a bag.” “Yes,” said Banér later,
“surely they had me there, but they forgot to tie the string
around.”</p>

<p>In Pomerania, Banér received the reinforcements from
Sweden which he had awaited, and once more invaded
Saxony, where he won a grand victory at Chemnitz, in
1639. The Swedish army invaded Bohemia, cruelly devastating
the country. Banér made a daring attack upon
Regensburg in order to make the emperor and the whole
German diet his prisoners. Sudden thaws frustrated the
plans, making it impossible for the Swedes to cross the
Danube. A superior force was sent to meet Banér, who
saved his army by another famous retreat back to Saxony.
On the way Banér was attacked by a fever and died at Halberstadt,
in 1641. When the imperialists learned of the
death of the Swedish Leonidas, they thought they could
easily defeat his army. The Swedes saw the approaching
enemy and collected around the coffin of their dead hero,
offering solemn pledges to fight for the glory of his name.
They then made a sudden attack upon the imperial army,
which suffered a thorough defeat at Wolfenbuttel. John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
Banér, triumphant in death like his great master, was buried
in the Swedish Pantheon of the Riddarholm.</p>

<p>Banér had expressed the wish that Lennart Torstensson
should succeed him as commander-general of the Swedish
armies. Lennart Torstensson was a greater warrior even
than John Banér; no Swedish general, Gustavus Adolphus
not excepted, ever reaching higher skill or perfection in the
science of war than this crippled hero. Torstensson was
of a noble although not influential family. He entered the
service of Gustavus Adolphus as a body page to the king,
later distinguishing himself as an artillery commander.
Torstensson took an honorable part in the battle of Breitenfeld,
but made a prisoner at Nuremberg, he lost his health,
during one year’s captivity, in a miserable dungeon. During
his later brilliant career he suffered greatly from rheumatism,
and was mostly carried around in a litter throughout
the battles which covered his name with undying fame.
He was a pious man of a gentle and cheerful disposition,
who tried his utmost to reintroduce among his troops the
excellent moral behavior and severe discipline which had
been lost after the death of Gustavus Adolphus.</p>

<p>Torstensson with rigor suppressed the intrigues against
Sweden which were secretly carried on within the army.
Brandenburg received a new elector in Frederic William,
who, ambitious and far-seeing, entered an alliance with the
victorious power of the North. Torstensson now was enabled
to invade the imperial crown lands, commencing with
Silesia; but finding it necessary to force a battle he met the
imperialists at Breitenfeld. October 23, 1642, the second
great victory of Breitenfeld was won by Swedish arms.
Archduke Leopold and Piccolomini led the imperial army,
the latter general fighting as a common soldier to inspire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
courage by his example, but with no effect. The Swedes
captured the baggage, cannon and banners of the enemy,
taking 5,000 prisoners and leaving as many dead imperialists
on the field. Torstensson conquered Leipsic on the
following day.</p>

<p>Torstensson marched through Bohemia and Moravia
with the rapidity which characterized all his military movements,
and penetrated to the very gates of Vienna, the emperor
with difficulty saving himself from being made his
prisoner. But suddenly he left and marched through Silesia
to North Germany. He had received an order from the
state council to attack Denmark. The great chancellor was
out of patience with the perfidy and intrigues of Christian
IV., who stood in secret connection with every one of Sweden’s
enemies. No previous declaration of war was made.
Torstensson captured the Danish duchies of Schleswig and
Holstein before any one could prevent it, his army then taking
possession of all Jutland. Gustavus Horn invaded
Scania, almost completely capturing the whole province in
spite of bands of freebooters among the peasants, called
<i>Snaphaner</i>.</p>

<p>Denmark was in danger of its very existence, but King
Christian IV. did not forget his old wish to destroy the
town of Gothenburg, whose growing prosperity caused him
envy. He approached Gothenburg with a fleet, and viewed
the town from the overlooking mountain of the Ramberg.
His demands for a surrender were refused. Patriotic Louis
de Geer had ordered from Holland a fleet at his own expense,
which was to go to the support of Gothenburg. It
did not arrive in time, but King Christian left to meet it,
and it later proved of great value in the Swedish movements
at sea, joining the Swedish fleet in the Sound. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
latter, consisting of twenty-two ships under the command
of Clas Fleming, sailed to the Danish waters, capturing
the island of Femern, supported by Torstensson. An invasion
of the island of Funen was planned, but could not be
effected. A great naval battle between the Swedish and
Danish fleets was fought July 6th. It caused great loss
on either side, without being decisive. King Christian,
who commanded his naval forces, lost one eye and received
over twenty different wounds. The Swedes kept the place
of battle, but sought the Bay of Skiel for repairs, where
they were hedged in by the Danish fleet. Clas Fleming
encouraged his followers to cut through the line, in which
they were successful. A month later he was killed by a
shot from the coast of Holstein, where the Danes had erected
a fort. The Swedes avenged the death of their valiant
commander by destroying the fort and killing its defenders.
Fleming was succeeded by Charles Gustavus Wrangel, who
saved the fleet to Sweden, returning to Femern in the autumn,
joined by the Dutch fleet of Louis de Geer. The
Danish fleet was met with October 13th, and at once scattered.
The swift-sailing Dutch ships went in pursuit and
destroyed all the seventeen Danish ships but two, which
brought the news of the disaster to Copenhagen.</p>

<p>King Christian, who had in vain expected support from
the emperor, found himself defeated on every point, and
had no other choice than to make peace. The treaty was
signed August 13, 1645, at Brœmsebro, Denmark ceding
the provinces of Jemtland and Herjedal and the islands
of Gothland and Œsel. The province of Halland was to
remain for thirty years in the possession of Sweden, which
country was exempt from duties of toll for the traffic in the
Sound. Denmark disavowed all claims of supremacy over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
Holstein, the duke of said country two years later formally
placing himself under Swedish protection.</p>

<p>Lennart Torstensson had fulfilled his task in Denmark
and returned to Germany. At Jueterbogk, in Brandenburg,
he met the imperial army, which had been sent to
cut off his retreat from Denmark, and entirely routed it.
After this victory Torstensson hastened to Bohemia, resolved
to “attack the emperor in his heart and force him to make
peace.” At Jankowitz, in Bohemia, Torstensson administered
a new and crushing defeat to the imperialists, in 1645.
The emperor, who himself had ordered his army to battle,
had arrived in Prague to witness the defeat of the Swedes,
which the Holy Virgin had promised him in a dream. He
soon learned the news, which was quite different from that
expected. The imperial commander-general, five generals
and eight colonels were made prisoners by the Swedes, who
captured the artillery and baggage of the enemy. The
health of Torstensson was at that moment so good that he
was able to lead the movements on horseback. He said
that such a bloody battle would not be seen for a long time.</p>

<p>Torstensson invaded Moravia, the fortresses surrendering
and the inhabitants fleeing in terror. For a second time
he stood at the walls of Vienna. The very fortifications
which protected the bridge across the Danube were captured
by the Swedes. The enemy, whom the elector of
Saxony had promised to chase out of Germany, was now
knocking at the gate of the emperor, who heard the report
with consternation. But Lennart Torstensson was forced
to surrender to a perfidious enemy, who came to his door
without knocking. His rheumatic ailment returned with
such violence that he was obliged to renounce his command
and return from the fields where he had led none but vic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>torious
armies. He was succeeded by Charles Gustavus
Wrangel. The latter had to give up the siege of Vienna,
but maintained, in connection with the French, the supremacy
in Germany until an honorable peace was won. Upon
his return to Sweden, Lennart Torstensson was covered
with distinctions, being made a baron and a count on one
and the same day. He was appointed governor-general
of West Gothland, Vermland, and the lately conquered
Halland, with his seat at Gothenburg, where he built himself
a palace (still the official residence of the governor of
Gothenburg and Bohuslæn). Lennart Torstensson died
in 1651, leaving behind the fame of one of the greatest warriors
known to history, and a spotless memory.</p>

<p>The treaty of peace of Westphalia was signed in October,
1648. The representatives of Sweden were John Oxenstierna,
a son of the great chancellor, and Adler Salvius.
Sweden received, as a reward for her decisive and glorious
part in the Thirty Years’ War, the following possessions:
West Pomerania, with the islands of Rugen and Usedom;
the western part of East Pomerania, with the island of
Wollin; the town of Wismar, with surrounding territory,
and the bishoprics of Bremen and Verden. With these
German possessions followed three votes at the German
Diet. The Swedish government was to receive a sum of
several millions to defray the army expenses, of which
Queen Christine recklessly ceded the larger part.</p>

<p>Through these glorious conditions of peace Sweden rose
to the rank of one of the mightiest of European empires,
which held the balance of power in Northern Europe. Her
possessions made the Baltic almost an “inland lake of Sweden,”
and efforts soon followed to make it completely so.
Sweden exerted a beneficent influence throughout her large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
possessions, which, from a cultural point of view, hardly
can be overestimated. Her methods of planting the seeds
of culture, by establishing Swedish and German universities,
and by abolishing serfdom in the conquered lands, are
worthy of the highest respect. But with her new political
grandeur Sweden acquired formidable enemies; she had
not the resources to sustain or defend her great possessions,
and the development of the mother country was for a time
misdirected by dreams of vain glory.</p>

<p>The government of Sweden during Christine’s minority,
according to the directions left by her father, consisted of
the five highest officials of the realm. Among these the
chancellor, through his experience and his former intimacy
with Gustavus Adolphus, was the leading spirit, king in all
except the name, and deserving the honorable surname of
“our greatest civilian,” given him by Swedish historians.
Unlike the majority of other uncrowned or crowned rulers,
he did not use his power to secure wealth or distinction for
himself and his family until upon his retirement. Offers
to make him a ruling prince of Germany, and the young
queen his son’s consort, were coldly refused. While the
war was going on he strengthened the foundations of the
centralization of the state by the government regulations
of 1634. At the side of the supreme court of Stockholm
another was established at Jœnkœping, for Gothaland, with
a state councillor as president. The system of various government
departments was enlarged upon.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The most important
of these was the chancery, in which all business to
come before the government was prepared. Departments
for commerce and for mining were established. Sweden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
was divided into eleven administrative districts, <i>læn</i>, later
increased to sixteen, each of these having a governor. Finland
was divided into five districts. Count Peter Brahe
the Younger, as governor-general of Finland, did more for
this neglected country than was ever done before to right
wrongs and foster prosperity. Livonia and Ingermanland
received each their governor-general, the latter province,
by repeated wars brought into a devastated condition, serving
as a place of deportation. This system of administration
won the admiration of the Continent and was in many
instances copied as a pattern of perfection. The Swedish
army was considered the finest in the world, and troops
better trained or more victorious did not exist. At the end
of the Thirty Years’ War about 100,000 men were under
Swedish command. The majority of these were foreigners,
who afterward were enlisted for continual service. Their
officers were raised in great numbers to the rank of nobles
and endowed with dignities and estates. The army was
divided into twenty regiments, seven of which were Finnish.
The town and coast population regularly furnished able
men for the navy. Much was done to improve the interior
communications by means of new roads and canals. A
postal route was established between Stockholm and Gothenburg,
and others followed. A Swedish postmaster in
Hamburg had charge of the foreign mails. Newspapers
were published, the government shaping for itself an organ
for official announcement which is yet published.</p>

<p>Great improvements were made in the mining industry,
thanks principally to the efforts of the noble immigrant,
Louis de Geer and his Walloons, who made the mines of
Dannemora a source of riches. Weapons and cannon were
manufactured not only for the army, but for exportation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
also. The brass foundries were excellent. The towns began
to flourish, especially Stockholm and Gothenburg,
through commerce with Holland and the Baltic States. A
Swedish colony, planned by Gustavus Adolphus through
the South Company, created by him in Gothenburg, was
founded in North America. In 1638 two ships, “Kalmar
Nyckel” and “Fogel Grip,” arrived at the mouth of the
Delaware River, where territory was procured through
honest purchase from the Indians. The Dutch in neighboring
colonies tried to persuade the Indians to oust the
newcomers, but the Swedish governor, Peter Menuet, won
their goodwill by fair dealing. The members of the colony
of New Sweden were honest, upright people, who dwelt in
peace with the natives. They accepted a governor appointed
by the government, in the person of John Printz,
but refused to tolerate among themselves criminals who
later were despatched to their colony, and these had to be
taken back. New Sweden after a few decades became the
prey of the Dutch, but many American families point with
justifiable pride to their descent from these honest and industrious
Swedish settlers. A Swedish colony on the coast
of African Guinea existed between 1650 and 1663, but was
through treacherous dealings turned over to the Dutch.</p>

<p>Much was done to build up the educational system,
several new colleges were established, and regulations made
to instruct the peasants. Peter Brahe founded the University
of Abo, in 1640, while in Finland, and the German
University of Greifswald, in Swedish Pomerania, was re-established.
Swedish men of learning began to attract
attention, such as John Skytte, who was considered the
most brilliant Latin scholar of Europe in his day, Stiernhœk,
the jurist, Bureus and Messenius, the historians, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
Georg Stiernhielm, poet and antiquarian. The old Icelandic
literature was discovered and began to exert a strong
influence on literature and science, to a great extent
strengthening their chauvinistic spirit. The Swedish poets
Stiernhielm, Runius, Holmstrœm, Lucidor and the poetess
Brenner, from the Eddic songs, which contain some of the
oldest humorous poems in existence, learned how to write
in a humorous vein, something entirely unknown in the
German and French literatures of that day.</p>

<p>The excellent government, of which Axel Oxenstierna
was the leading spirit, had its defects. In its perfect system
of administration, which in the main features stands
unshaken to this day, there appeared to be no room for
the people themselves to be governed. On account of the
great allowances made to the nobles it was necessary to
increase the taxes of the peasants. Many had to leave
their homes and farms for want of resources to pay their
taxes; others were forced away from their property by the
nobles. There was danger of the destruction of the free,
self-dependent yeomanry. A hatred against the nobility
grew up. The great lords returned from the wars laden with
booty, erected fine castles, and continued the high living
to which they had become accustomed while abroad. The
power of the nobility was increased by lavish donations from
Queen Christine and by the appropriation of other crown
lands which the government was forced to sell or mortgage
on account of the wars. The clergy were the spokesmen
of the peasant class at the Riksdag, every year demanding
with greater emphasis a restitution to the crown of its property,
which was held by the nobles.</p>

<p>Queen Christine herself took the reins of government,
in 1644, at the age of eighteen. She had inherited from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
her illustrious father some of his genius, and from her
mother, Marie Eleonore of Brandenburg, a peculiar nervous
disposition. Her mother took no interest in her until the
death of Gustavus Adolphus, when a flood of exalted tenderness
suddenly was let loose over her. Count Jacob de
la Gardie took the lead in opposing the undesirable and
unstable character of this relation, Christine being separated
from her mother and educated by the Countess-Palatine
Catherine, a pious and noble woman, the older sister
of Gustavus Adolphus. Greatly offended, Marie Eleonore
left the country never to return. Queen Christine showed
a remarkable faculty of absorbing knowledge. Well versed
in a great number of languages, and well read in various
sciences, particularly mathematics, she soon acquired fame
as the most learned woman of her time. She was of frank
countenance, slept little, cared little for dress, and was
passionately fond of hunting and riding on horseback.
Queen Christine possessed a sharp intellect, was daring
and resolute, but headstrong, fickle, extravagant, and but
little particular in her choice of favorites. Her vanity and
egotism knew no bounds. At the beginning of her reign
she took pains to give serious attention to the affairs of
state. The great chancellor had been her instructor in
economics and statecraft, but she repaid him by open coldness
and secret antagonism. Her ambition to surround herself
with scientists of note, particularly foreigners who flattered
her vanity by blowing her fame to the four corners
of the earth, killed her interest for politics. Later she was
seized by the evil spirit of frivolity, abandoning herself to
empty pleasures and to excesses of extravagance when her
learned admirers were forgotten for unworthy favorites.
Among the latter, Count Magnus Gabriel de la Gardie was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
for a long time all-powerful. The grandson of General
Pontus and a daughter of John III., he was the son of
Count Jacob de la Gardie and Ebba Brahe, and one of the
most brilliant noblemen of Europe. In his youth he formed
an intimate friendship with the dauphin of France, later
Louis XIV., who throughout his life honored him with the
title of “Mon Cousin,” or “Mon cher Cousin.” His ambition
to become Queen Christine’s consort was never satisfied,
nor was he allowed to accept the rank of a prince
from the German emperor, but the queen made him the
richest man in her realm. Magnus de la Gardie did not
possess the sterling qualities of his ancestors, but was of
great patriotism and lavishly liberal toward educational
institutions, in this respect without a peer in Swedish history.
In 1666 he founded the Academy of Antiquities,
which was the first archæological institution in Europe,
the Swedish antiquarians of the day, principal among them
Bureus and Stiernhielm, doing valuable antiquarian research.
In 1664, Count de la Gardie donated to the University
Library of Upsala a highly valuable collection of
manuscripts and books, chiefly from Iceland. In the collection
was also the Gothic Bible translation of Bishop Wulfila
in the only copy extant. Liberal with his silver, Count de
la Gardie gave to the precious book a silver binding, as he
had in earlier years presented to Queen Christine a silver
throne (which is still in use). This book has an interesting
history of its own.</p>

<p>Codex Argenteus, the silver book, thus called on account
of its silver binding, contains fragments of the four
Gospels in the Gothic language. The translation was made
from the Greek original by Bishop Wulfila (b. 318-d. 388),
the apostle of the Goths. The writing is done in so-called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
encaustum (printing with heated stamps) of gold and silver
letters on vellum of scarlet color. This copy is considered
to have been made toward the end of the fifth or in the
beginning of the sixth century, when the East Goths still
held sway in Italy. Its early fortunes are unknown, but
it is supposed that the book was found in the possession of
the Visigoths (or West Goths) when their empire was seized
by the Franks, and donated to the monastery of Verden by
some munificent Frankish chief. Here, in the Benedictine
abbey of Verden, on the river Ruhr, in Westphalia, the
book was discovered at least as early as 1554, when the
scholars Cassander and Gualther of Cologne are known to
have had copies which can have been made from no other
source.</p>

<p>After the outbreak of the Thirty Years’ War, the Codex
was transmitted to Prague for safety. In the year of
1648, Prague, or rather the older portion of the town, was
captured by the Swedish general, Count Hans Christopher
Kœnigsmark, who, among the vast treasures of the Bohemian
capital, found also the Codex Argenteus which he
presented to Queen Christine. All the books and manuscripts
of the queen were in the care of her librarian, Isaac
Vossius, a learned but eccentric scholar of Dutch parentage.
Vossius was at first Queen Christine’s teacher of Greek, not
a very agreeable position, for the queen called him to the
castle at three o’clock in the morning for her first hour.
In 1650 he had to leave court and country on account of a
quarrel with that light of learning, Claude de Saumaise
(Salmasius), another one of the foreign scholars in favor
with the queen. In 1653 he was called back, and again took
charge of the books of the queen, but soon returned to Holland.
Before his departure he gathered several costly books<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
and manuscripts, among which Codex Argenteus, with or
without the queen’s private permission, taking them with
him. In 1670, Vossius came to England, where he died,
in 1688, as court chaplain at Windsor. King Charles II. of
England said of him: “Vossius believes in anything but the
Bible.”</p>

<p>When in Holland, the Codex Argenteus passed out of
the hands of Vossius after his uncle Franziskus Junius had
made a complete copy of it. Junius, called the “grandfather
of modern philology,” published the first edition
of Codex Argenteus at Dortrecht, in 1665, providing the
beautiful fac-simile with parallel Old English texts and a
Gothic glossary. In Holland the Codex changed hands
repeatedly until found in Brabant by Samuel Pufendorff,
in 1661, who, in the following year, bought it for Count
de la Gardie, paying a sum of something like $1,200
for it.</p>

<p>Once more in Sweden the Codex Argenteus was made
the subject of close attention, a new edition of it being published,
in 1671, by Georg Stiernhielm, the innovator of
Swedish language and literature.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> That Bishop Wulfila’s
Bible should ultimately harbor in Sweden does not seem
out of place, for of all languages now spoken the Swedish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
comes closest to the language of the Goths as crystallized
during its classical epoch. The interest taken by Swedish
scholars in the book has always been great and fruitful of
results, in times when it was thought to be written in the
mother tongue of all the Teutonic languages, as well as
later, when Gothic was found to be, not the mother, but
the oldest sister in the family.</p>

<p>At the Riksdag of 1649 considerable dissatisfaction was
directed against the nobility and the extravagance of the
queen in deeding over to favorites all the possessions of the
crown, in form of counties and baronies. The nobility
sided against the queen, desirous of reducing her power.
But Queen Christine received gracefully the complaints
made, and promised to institute a reduction of taxes and
payments. In the following year the commotion increased
when the same taxes were asked as in time of war. The
queen continued her policy of earnestly considering the
requests of the lower Estates, thus gaining the controlling
power. The nobility, suffering strife between its various
classes, was forced to seek a shelter in the royal power it
desired to crush, and humiliated itself before the queen.
Christine received a joint appeal from the lower Estates
for a restitution to the crown of all property illegally turned
over to the nobility, but she managed to have the reform
postponed upon promise of some minor privileges and a
reduction of taxes. She refused the appeals of the nobility
to have the clergymen and others punished who had used
hard language against the aristocrats. But the discontent
was spreading and turned against the queen personally.
The ministers preached against the wrongs and violence
of the mighty ones; the nobles and the peasants threatened
each other. Peasants in Finland refused to work for aristo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>cratic
masters, and a general rebellion seemed imminent.
In the meantime Queen Christine was crowned at Upsala
amid great display and elaborate festivities, the count-palatine
Charles Gustavus, her cousin, being installed as heir-apparent
to the throne.</p>

<p>But Queen Christine was not able to still the storm
around her. The finances of the crown were utterly ruined
by her extravagance, and she dared not take by violence
from the nobility what she had given by grace. In 1651
she declared it to be her intention to leave the government,
but was persuaded to remain. Her cousin was placed in a
very difficult position, apparently taking no interest in what
was going on, but following everything with the keenest
attention. The son of John Casimir, count of Palatinate-Zweibrucken,
and Princess Catherine, he was born at Nykœping
in Sweden, in 1622, and designated as the future
consort of Queen Christine. Charles Gustavus was educated
in simplicity and rigor, and was, as his father before
him, utterly neglected by Axel Oxenstierna and the government.
He slept in a room without wallpaper, and when
through with his lessons he sawed wood with his teacher,
Professor Lenæus. Burning with ambition, and perhaps
also in love with his brilliant cousin, he proposed to her
repeatedly, but in vain. After several years of extensive
travel he joined Lennart Torstensson, refusing a command
and working himself up through the military degrees. He
took an honorable part in the victory at Jankowitz, and
was appointed supreme commander of the Swedish armies
shortly before the close of the German war. When the
opposition against Christine reached its climax a good deal
was expected from Charles Gustavus, which he, on account
of his singular position, could not undertake to do. A peti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>tion
replete with abusive language about the queen was sent
him, asking him to take hold of the government. Charles
turned the document over to the queen. Its author, the
promising young Arnold Messenius, and his father, an able
historian, suspected as having inspired his son, were accused
of high treason, condemned to death and executed.</p>

<p>This act of force produced an impression, and the new
taxes demanded at the next Riksdag were granted without
opposition. But the queen felt that the discontent was only
subdued, not suppressed, and, having no further means to
keep up a luxurious court, she did the wisest act of her
reign, that of resigning, at Upsala, in June, 1654, Charles
Gustavus being crowned the same day. The scene of her
abdication was very impressive, Queen Christine carrying
herself with noble and lofty dignity, an inheritance from
her father which she made use of when she saw fit. Leaving
the crown and the royal emblems, one by one, to the
Riksdrotset, she descended the throne, from the lowest steps
of which she spoke an eloquent and touching farewell to
the four Estates of the Riksdag. She suddenly left the
country after having secured for herself a princely income.
At Innsbruck, the daughter of Gustavus Adolphus joined
the Catholic church, thereby, and by her fame as a learned
woman, creating a sensation. She died in Rome in 1689,
after having made two unsuccessful attempts to regain her
Swedish throne, and one equally unsuccessful to succeed
the last king of the Polish line of the Vasa dynasty, and
was buried in the church of St. Peter.</p>

<p>Among the many learned men who at one time surrounded
Christine were Vossius, Heinsius, Salmasius, Huet,
Freinshemius, Loccenius, Meibom, Bœclerus, Ravius, Schefferus,
and others. The greatest of them all, the philoso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>pher
Cartesius (René Descartes), died in Stockholm, in
1650.</p>

<p>After the love-story of Gustavus Adolphus had come
to an end, he long felt a disinclination to marry. His sister
Catherine is said to have tried to rouse him to the necessity
of choosing a consort. His answer was always: “Never
mind, dear sister, you shall yourself bring up a son to inherit
the crown and continue my work.” This son of Catherine
became Queen Christine’s successor.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Period of Political Grandeur&mdash;Charles X. and
Charles XI.</i></span></h2>

<p>Charles X. was one of the most ambitious men
ever placed upon a throne, and Europe was soon
to realize that a new war-lord was come. His ambition,
so long unsatisfied and secreted, burst forth with
uncontrollable strength, in compass only to be equalled by
his rare gifts of mind and heart. Charles Gustavus had
suffered a good deal of neglect, coldness and hatred, but
when ascending the throne he seemed to have forgotten all
this. Oxenstierna died a few months after the abdication
of Queen Christine, deeply impressed by the magnanimity
and genius of the new sovereign. Charles Gustavus was
one of the most highly gifted of Swedish monarchs. He
had a great deal of interest in and rare discernment for the
requirements of a peaceful development. But reared in
the most warlike of times, when a reputation could be made
only by winning so and so many “victorias” for the firm
establishment of a hero’s “gloire,” Charles Gustavus
thought that only the monarch favored by “Fama” would
have the prestige to lead firmly the fate of his people. He
often expressed the wish to rest from his campaigns in order
to contemplate his work and make it beneficial to his people,
but such a rest he never gave himself time to enjoy during
his short and remarkable reign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>Charles burned with desire to gain fame in war, taking
for pretext that the king of Poland, by his repeated claims
to the Swedish throne, made peace treacherous and impossible.
But such was the condition of affairs that something
must be done to quiet the malcontent people, restore
peace between the quarrelling classes, and reimburse the
empty state treasury. At a Riksdag in Stockholm, in 1655,
a restitution was proposed by the king and agreed to, according
to which all estates which in earlier times had been
rendering dues to the direct support of the court, army,
fleet, or administration, should be confiscated to the crown;
also one-fourth of the estates given away since the death
of Gustavus Adolphus, and all estates fraudulently obtained.
A committee to enforce the restitution was appointed,
to be presided over by the able Herman Fleming.
The restitution, far from radical in itself, was not completely
carried through, thanks to the opposing nobles.
But it proved effective for the moment, the king securing
the goodwill of the people, temporary quiet and means to
carry on the proposed war, to commence which Charles
Gustavus received the somewhat reluctant consent of the
faithful people whose financial state was a most despairing
one. Charles X. thought in new conquests to find means
to better their condition. Shortly after his coronation he
married Hedvig Eleonore of Holstein-Gottorp.</p>

<p>John II. Casimir of Poland, the younger son of Sigismund,
like Vladislav, styled himself king of Sweden and
had claims to Livonia. For this he should be punished.
It was not the original intention of Charles X. to make
himself king of Poland, but he was probably the first who
ever devised a division of that unhappy country. The success
of Charles X. was without a parallel. The strong for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>tresses
were captured, the armies surrendered and registered
in Swedish service. After two months Charles X. entered
the old capital of Cracow, John Casimir fled from his country,
and, carried away by the frenzy of success, Charles
Gustavus had himself crowned king of Poland. West
Prussia was captured, and the elector of Brandenburg, who
held East Prussia in fief, and the duke of Courland were
forced to become the vassals of Sweden, in 1656.</p>

<p>But Charles X. had roused an enemy that few invaders,
however great, have been able to successfully encounter,
the spirit of patriotism. The Poles, enticed to revolt by
the Catholic clergy, found a leader in the noble Czarniecki,
who commenced a war of liberation on the Swedish
usurper. King John Casimir returned, and armies were
gathered. Charles Gustavus was yet to do wonders of
strategy, which aroused the amazement and fear of all
Europe, but he was glad, when finding a good excuse,
to extract himself from the affairs of Poland. In
1656 he defeated Czarniecki at Golumbo, undertook the
adventurous crossing of the river of San, and captured,
and recaptured, the capital of Warsaw. The “three days’
battle of Warsaw” (18th-20th of July, 1656) is one of the
most famous in modern warfare, by which the reputation
of Charles X., as one of the greatest warriors of his time,
was firmly established. Charles X. had joined forces with
the “great elector” of Brandenburg, who up to the last
moment was unwilling to risk a battle of 22,000 men
against an enemy twice as strong. Charles Gustavus was
unyielding and turned it into a great victory. But his
position became precarious, Russia, Germany, Holland and
Denmark being hostile, joined by Brandenburg, the ambitious
“great elector” not being satisfied with the Swedish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
supremacy in East Prussia. To save himself from the
dilemma with untarnished glory, Charles X. decided to
fight Denmark, which country had declared war without
suspecting the possibility of an attack.</p>

<p>Lennart Torstensson, his master of strategy, had shown
Charles X. how Denmark was to be attacked. With an
army of only 8,000, but consisting of the choicest and most
victorious troops in all Europe, Charles X. hastened in rapid
marches through Pomerania and Mecklenburg, recaptured
Bremen, and invaded through friendly Holstein all of Schleswig
and Jutland, defeating the larger but inexperienced Danish
army and capturing the strong fortress of Fredericia.</p>

<p>Yet the new position was as precarious as the one in
Poland, and Charles had to use all the skill of his diplomacy
to save his little army from an assault by inimical Europe.
France and England seemed unwilling to render him effective
help. But when the elector of Brandenburg, who had
taken upon himself the leadership of Sweden’s enemies,
turned to the emperor, emphasizing the necessity of crushing
the Swedish power in one blow, he received the following
surprising answer: “The king of Hungary has no reason
to be the enemy of the king of Sweden.” Charles had
reached a secret understanding with Austria. By this
move he gained time. Through what seemed almost a
miracle, he was not only to save his army but lead it on
to victory after a strategic deed, in originality and daring
unique in the history of the world.</p>

<p>The year of 1658 commenced with severe frosts.
Charles X. conceived the daring plan of attacking the
Danish isles by leading his army over the frozen sounds.
He concluded to cross the sound of Lille Belt, opposite the
islet of Brandsœ. His quartermaster-general, Eric Dahl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>berg,
an engineer of great genius, ascertained that the ice
was safe. One frosty winter morning, the 30th of January,
the Swedish army, reinforced to 9,000 men, marched down
on the ice, safely reaching Brandsœ at sunrise. A Danish
army, arranged in order of battle in the island of Funen,
was defeated. While crossing over to Funen, the ice
cracked under two squadrons of cavalry, those who followed
not daring to proceed. The king himself hurried
past the dangerous place, pointing out a safe course, and
the troops followed him.</p>

<p>The most dangerous part remained to cross, the much
wider sound of Store Belt, in order to reach Seeland.
Charles first thought of taking the direct route of two
miles, but commissioned Dahlberg to explore the condition
of the ice across to the smaller islands to the south. Dahlberg
did so, and said he would wager his head for its perfectly
safe condition. In enthusiasm, Charles clapped his
hands exclaiming: “Now, brother Frederic, we will converse
in good Swedish!” In the night between the 5th and
6th of February, the Swedish army marched from Svendborg
in Funen over the ice to Langeland. “It was terrible,”
wrote an eye-witness, “to march through the night
over this frozen sea, where the horses’ hoofs had thawed
down the snow on the ice, which was below two feet of
water, and where we, in every moment, were in fear
of striking the open sea.” At dawn the army landed in
Langeland. During the rest for breakfast, frozen beer was
chopped and distributed in pieces to the soldiers. The
march continued over the still wider sound to Laaland,
Eric Dahlberg in front, directing the march. Reaching
Grimsted in Laaland at three o’clock in the afternoon, and
proceeding to Nakskov, Charles Gustavus was met, at mid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>night,
by the burgomaster and council of said town, who
surrendered its keys. The 9th of February, the army stood
in Falster, and a few days later was collected at the captured
castle of Vordingborg in Seeland. Peace was hastily
offered and agreed to on the 17th, and the treaty of peace
signed the 28th of February, 1658, at Rœskilde. The conditions
were severe, Denmark ceding the provinces of
Scania, Halland, Bleking and Bohuslæn, the whole district
or diocese of Drontheim in Norway, and the island
of Bornholm, and agreeing to hold the Baltic closed to
hostile fleets with the help of Sweden. The last clause
was a piece of a Scandinavian policy devised by the Swedish
king.</p>

<p>Charles X. now prepared to meet Brandenburg and
Austria, once more siding against Sweden. It was necessary
to keep Holland out from the Baltic, and when Charles
X. found Denmark unwilling to keep the conditions of the
recent treaty on that point, the war-lord became wrathful,
dooming obnoxious Denmark to lose her very existence.
But the spirit of patriotism, which so often had saved Sweden
in instances of extreme danger, now sided with Denmark,
as it had already sided with Poland. King Frederic
declared he would die like a bird in its own nest, and roused
the patriotism of the population of Copenhagen, which,
badly defended, was hurriedly fortified at the news of an
intended attack. Contrary to the advice of Eric Dahlberg,
Charles X. made no instantaneous attack, but commenced
a siege, although he did not bring with him the necessary
means. The castle of Kronborg by Elsinore was captured
and its cannon used against Copenhagen. The greatest
enthusiasm prevailed in the Danish capital; the king slept
in a tent by the fortifications, and especially the students<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
and Norwegian sailors distinguished themselves by their
valor and patriotism. Charles X. found it impossible to
take Copenhagen and retired to some distance from the
capital. What caused Charles to retire was the arrival
of a Dutch fleet. It had been met by the Swedish fleet,
under command of Charles Gustavus Wrangel, the hero
of Fredericia and Kronborg. After six hours of hard fighting
the Dutch forced the entrance to the Sound. Before
leaving, the Swedish king resolved to make a desperate
effort to capture Copenhagen, defended by 13,000 troops
and by a patriotic population, with his 8,000 Swedes. The
attack was made in the night of February 11, 1659, but the
city, forewarned by traitors, tendered the Swedes a warm
reception, consisting of artillery fire, stones, and scalding
hot water. The Swedes lost 600 men and suffered their
first and only defeat under the command of Charles X.</p>

<p>The situation was grave. The Swedish army in Jutland
was forced to retire; the troops of 5,000 men in Funen
were defeated and made prisoners; a revolt took place in
Bornholm, and the Danes recaptured the district of Drontheim.
The powers united in their efforts to force Sweden
and Denmark to a treaty of peace on the basis of the Rœskilde
stipulations. Charles still held his head high, declaring
that he would crush the fleets of the allies if they tried
to interfere in the affairs of the North, striking a sharply
discordant note in the concert of the powers. To Denmark
he was willing to cede the district of Drontheim, but prepared
to occupy that of Akkershus instead, when he was
taken ill at the convening Riksdag at Gothenburg, dying
February 11, 1660, in the palace erected by his friend Lennart
Torstensson.</p>

<p>Charles X. Gustavus was one of the most remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
men of his day, whose wonderful deeds of bravery and
genius caused amazement through their brilliancy, and
anxiety through their recklessness. At the first glance his
appearance gave no idea of the real man. He was short,
and of an unusually square and clumsy build, with a head
of coarse proportions. But there was the fire of genius in
his sharp blue eyes; under the black hair, and below the
thin black mustache, there was a mouth of firm and resolute
lines. In the versatility of his endowment, he stands
as one of the first among Swedish kings, the rich gifts of
the Vasas and the Wittelsbachs being united in him. As
a warrior he was great, yet more of a tactician than a
strategist. As a statesman his views were almost as clairvoyant
as those of his grandfather, Charles IX., but he
gave way to the impressions and impulses of the moment.
He failed to make the Baltic a Swedish inland lake, but
gained for his country the inestimable gift of a natural
frontier to the east and south, by the acquisition of Bohuslæn,
Halland, Scania and Bleking, provinces more valuable
to Sweden than a whole empire south of the Baltic.</p>

<p><i>Charles XI.</i> was a child of four years at the death of
his father; his country at war with a world, and in a
sorely afflicted condition. In the will of Charles X., the
queen-dowager, Hedvig Eleonore, was named to preside
over the government, with two votes, and the brother of
Charles X., the duke Adolphus John, was to take a seat
with her as Riksmarsk. This arrangement displeased the
nobility, understanding that it was directed against their
influence, and they had the duke excluded from the government.
The lower Estates of the Riksdag sided with
the duke, but soon gave up his cause as they found that
he was utterly vain, quick-tempered, and without stability<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
or genius. Lars Kagg, a good warrior, was appointed
Riksmarsk in his place. Herman Fleming, the able state
treasurer, was removed as disagreeable to the nobility, his
ill-health being taken as an excuse, and was succeeded by
Gustavus Bonde. Peter Brahe remained Riksdrotset, Magnus
Gabriel de la Gardie state chancellor, and Charles Gustavus
Wrangel state admiral. Kagg died in 1661 and was
succeeded by Wrangel, Gustavus Otto Stenbock becoming
state admiral.</p>

<p>The first duty of the new government was to make peace
for the bleeding country. This was effected in 1660 through
the treaties of Oliva and Copenhagen, and in a most satisfactory
manner, speaking high for the diplomatic ability
of the governing ones, but also of the ignorance of
the powers of the utter helplessness of Sweden, in great
contrast to her outward political grandeur. Poland ceded
Livonia to Sweden, and Denmark all the territory gained
by Charles X., except the district of Drontheim and the
island of Bornholm, while Russia was satisfied with the
boundaries set by Gustavus Adolphus.</p>

<p>The government, with care and consideration, made
the necessary arrangements to have the new provinces
intimately connected with the country. Representatives
were sent to the Riksdag of 1664, and the University of
Lund, in Scania, was founded in 1668. If to this is added
that a good deal was done to encourage art and science,
principally through Count Magnus de la Gardie, who was
the Mæcenas of Sweden, the meritorious deeds of the government
during Charles XI.’s minority are enumerated.
The less that is said of it in addition, and of its leading
men, the better for these. They were men of some patriotism,
but, through their exceedingly aristocratic views and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
lack of stability, unable to further the interests of their
country, so badly in need of reform. There was not one
of them who possessed the abilities of a statesman. They
lived like princes in their counties, each holding court and
possessing various considerable castles, all the members
of the higher aristocracy upholding the same standard of
luxury and power, appointing clergymen and judges, founding
towns, and discussing the necessity of having mints
and coins of their own. Magnus de la Gardie, count of
Leckœ, and married to a sister of Charles X., was the
greatest of these lords. Close to him came Peter Brahe,
count of Visingsborg, and Charles Gustavus Wrangel,
count of Skokloster. The barons approached the counts
in their display of wealth. The lower nobility, whose
members often served at the courts of the great lords, were
not satisfied with this state of affairs. But in the contempt
and oppression in which they held the lower classes, they
agreed with the higher nobility, who made no secret of
their intention to reduce the peasants to slaves. The peasantry,
suffering and neglected, became the prey of a superstition
which was shared by the more educated members
of society, accusations and legal executions of witches becoming
numerous.</p>

<p>The government was not agreed between themselves
upon many questions and turned to the state council for
support. The old privileged class of councillors forced their
influence upon the government, and the position between
the two became quite intimate, at the same time difficult
to define. The state council was as divided in its opinions
as the government, which fact had a disastrous influence
upon state politics and administration. Great negligence
was shown in the various departments, the records of re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>ceipts
and expenditures being imperfect, and a constant lack
of funds existing. Forgery and thefts were committed by
high and low officials. Administrative orders were not
obeyed. The army and the navy suffered utter neglect.</p>

<p>During such a state of affairs the abominable practice
of receiving “subsidies” came into use. The government
received, now from one foreign power, now from another,
a large sum of money to back its respective interests with
the military forces or the diplomatic influence of Sweden.
This practice, ignoble in itself, injured the dignity of the
state and had a demoralizing influence. Thanks to it,
Sweden sided sometimes against, but mostly with, France,
her old ally, who, in Count de la Gardie, had an enthusiastic
friend. In 1662, Sweden schemed with France for
the election of a French prince as king of Poland; in 1667,
she formed, with England and Holland, a triple alliance
against France. Louis XIV. soon won back the friendship
of the government of Sweden, thus having this country as
his only ally when reaching the climax of his success. At
last the Swedish promises to send an army against the
elector of Brandenburg were fulfilled. It was under the
command of the old and invalid Count Wrangel, and suffered
defeats at Ratenau and Fehrbellin, in 1675. These
were of little importance, or extension, in themselves, but
they injured the prestige of Sweden, so long supremely
victorious on German soil, and caused her enemies to combine
their efforts in order to regain their lost possessions.</p>

<p>Charles XI. was declared of age at seventeen, in 1672,
when he himself took charge of the government, yet for
a few years standing under the influence of Count de la
Gardie. King Charles was, as a child, physically weak,
and the astrologers had prophesied that he would die an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
infant. For this reason the queen-dowager, a very ordinary
woman, gave all her attention to have her son develop
a strong and sound constitution. The child was given its
own way in everything, casting aside books and rules for
his individual pleasures. King Charles grew up an ignorant
self-willed and headstrong youth, who delighted in
hunting and reckless riding on horseback. His companions,
manners and language were not of the choicest order,
and he remained all his life shy and awkward in demeanor.
From his thirteenth year he was made acquainted with the
routine of state affairs, but he lacked the qualifications to
grasp them in detail. He surrounded himself with members
of the lower nobility, but was well at ease only among
ministers, burghers and peasants. Charles XI. was all his
life of an unrestrained temper and an indomitable will, coming
to the throne the most ignorant king Sweden had had
for centuries. But he was pious, sincere and just, and his
morals pure and severe. Through the hardest of lessons,
Charles XI. was to develop his great uncultivated gifts,
to become the liberator of his people and one of its most
remarkable rulers.</p>

<p>Sweden had to encounter many enemies after the battle
of Fehrbellin, and a chain of disasters followed, nearly
crushing the young king under their weight. Holland,
Austria, Brandenburg and Denmark attacked the Swedish
possessions, which were all captured, one after the other.
Charles was not able to send reinforcements, the navy
being in a miserable condition, and when rejuvenated,
through strenuous effort, defeated by the excellent admirals
Juel, of the Danish, and Tromp, of the Dutch, navy. The
treasury was empty, the administration in disorder, and
mistrust and strife reigned supreme. But the young king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
showed that he wanted to be obeyed, and managed, by
hard work, to establish order, the Riksdag sacrificing means
to organize the defence.</p>

<p>The Danes were successful in their first expeditions on
land also, their army having undergone a reorganization.
King Christian V. marched into Scania, while his general,
Gyldenlœve, invaded Bohuslæn and West Gothland. The
hostile fleets captured the islands of Œland and Gothland.
Charles XI., in a sinister state of mind verging on despair,
at last had his army collected, and entered Halland, where
Danish troops were encountered and defeated at Halmstad.
This gave courage to the Swedes, who soon thought themselves
invincible, when commanded by the young king
himself. Charles received reinforcements through peasant
troops, and was desirous to meet Christian in open battle.
But the Danish army in Scania retreated until forced to
meet the enemy near Lund. Here a bloody and decisive
battle was fought, more than 8,000 men being killed, and
resulting in a victory for the Swedes, who took 2,000 prisoners,
fifty-one cannon, and the whole hostile camp, December
3, 1676.</p>

<p>In the following year Sweden suffered two defeats at
sea, through the hands of Juel, but won another victory
on land, at Landskrona, when the Danes lost 3,000 men.</p>

<p>While Charles XI. fought with the courage of despair,
Louis XIV. was supremely victorious over his enemies, soon
appearing as the dictator of Europe, when peace was made
at Nimwegen, in 1679. Finding Charles XI. resolved not
to cede any of his territory, King Louis took a similar
standpoint in his behalf, but contemptuously neglected to
let the Swedish ambassadors take any active part in the
deliberations. Louis XIV. made peace with the emperor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
Brandenburg and Denmark on behalf of Sweden, which
country only ceded a small part of East Pomerania to Brandenburg.
Charles XI. deeply felt the insolence of the benevolent
dictator, and forced Christian V. to sign a treaty
of peace at Lund, in 1680, as if Louis XIV. had no part in
it. An agreement was made that Charles XI. should
marry the sister of Christian V., the beautiful Ulrica
Eleonore. Through her gentleness, piety and great benevolence,
she soon acquired fame as one of the noblest queens
of Sweden. Ulrica Eleonore led a quiet life, seldom being
seen at court, where the vain and despotic queen-dowager
held the first place. She was never able to win the affection
of her consort until during her last illness. King
Charles then, for the first time, understood what a treasure
he had held unappreciated at his side, and watched over
her with infinite care, bringing peace and sunshine into her
last days. After her death, in 1693, the king became a
prey to deep sorrow and remorse, which threw added gloom
over his dark countenance. The queen had been active in
upholding a good relation between the Scandinavian countries,
often bitterly opposed by the queen-dowager, in the
interests of Holstein.</p>

<p>When peace was made, Charles XI. immediately took
action in the matter of reform. He saw his country at the
verge of utter ruin and the crown unable to help it. The peasants
were losing their rights, one by one, and five-sixths of the
crown lands were in the possession of the nobles. Brought
up in ignorance and isolation, finding rottenness and incapability
everywhere, it was no wonder that the king
became strongly imbued by the spirit of absolutism, which
pervaded all Europe. He followed the example of the monarchs
of France and Denmark, learning from them how, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
secret agitation and pressure, to make the lower classes
fervently appeal to him to take the absolute power in his
hand. His principal adviser was <i>John Gyllenstierna</i>, a
man of old, celebrated stock, but belonging to the lower
nobility. Gyllenstierna was one of the greatest and most
patriotic statesmen of his day. He first attracted attention
as a champion of the lower nobility against the great lords
for the restitution of crown lands. Raised to dignities and
a high station, he never changed his position to the aristocrats
in power, who thought they could win him over by
favors. Seeing the absolute impossibility of reform, with
the help of the nobles, Gyllenstierna turned to the king,
whose whole confidence he won, inspiring him with plans
of a Scandinavian peace policy, and a reform through the
destruction of the aristocracy. Gyllenstierna died after
having brought to the king his bride, a union which was
the work of this able statesman.</p>

<p>The Riksdag was convoked to meet October 5, 1680.
Everything commenced quietly. No royal proposition was
made; but a strong agitation had been set in motion
among the four Estates, the three lower ones sending in a
petition to make the royal power absolute, to have a restitution
of crown lands made, and the government, during the
king’s minority, brought to answer for their acts. Similar
requests were sent up from the nobility, after many stormy
scenes at the Riddarhus. Thus, toward the end of the
Riksdag, with the petitions in, came the royal propositions
which, when accepted, in one blow crushed the aristocracy,
as a ruling class, and the antiquated state council, as an
institution, and established the absolute power of the king.</p>

<p>According to the resolutions of this memorable Riksdag,
which marks a new era in Swedish history, a “grand com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>mission”
was selected which fulfilled its duties with the
greatest severity. The members of the former government
and state council were made responsible for their administration,
and themselves, or their heirs, sentenced to pay
smaller or larger sums. Two-thirds of the whole amount
was afterward given up, but the fines were nevertheless
great. Count Nils Brahe, the heir of both Peter Brahe and
Charles Gustavus Wrangel, and the wealthiest man in
Sweden, had to pay something like $600,000 in fines, an
immense sum in those days, and was reduced almost to poverty.
The restitution department, assisted by two commissions,
did equally thorough work under the pressure of the
king. Ten counties and seventy baronies, with a great
number of other crown lands of various classes, were confiscated.
It cost the higher nobility dearly; Count Magnus
de la Gardie, the all-powerful favorite of three monarchs,
lost his immense wealth and died on a little estate left him,
with one single servant out of his former princely retinue.
The work of restitution was carried on without cruelty or
injustice.</p>

<p>A second restitution was to follow. The propositions
were arranged at the Riksdag of 1682, in the same way
as in 1680. This time the lower nobility was to suffer. All
crown lands rendering less than $600 a year of income had
been spared; now these were confiscated, without exception.
In 1686 followed another blow. The dividends on the state
loans were reduced, and a stipulation made that holders
of bonds must refund what they, up to that date, had received
above the new schedule. The same principle was
applied in the redemption of mortgaged state lands. These
new harsh measures were enforced with a great deal of severity,
with incidental cases of injustice. The king showed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
clemency only to certain parties in stringent need. The
discontent of the nobles caused many of them to leave the
country, as, for instance, Count Otto William von Kœnigsmarck,
son of the conqueror of Prague, and himself the valiant
defender of Pomerania against the hostile allies. Their
example was followed by many nobles of Livonia, the
measures of the restitution entirely crushing the nobility
of that province, while its peasants, who were slaves,
gained their liberty, and had every reason to bless the
Swedish government.</p>

<p>The power of absolutism grew steadily stronger. The
king decided all matters alone, and prepared in advance the
measures he proposed to the Riksdag, of whose sanction
he was as independent as of that of the old state council.
All officers and institutions were also changed in name from
“state” to “royal” servants and instruments. The university
professors were instructed to impress the students
with the necessity and divine rights of an absolute ruler.
The nobles were alone in their discontent. The other
classes, especially the peasants, looked with satisfaction
and approval on the work which crushed the enemies of
their liberty and prosperity, and submitted willingly to the
absolute power because it was in the hands of a patriotic
king.</p>

<p>Charles XI. used the revenues of the restitutions principally
for the reorganization of army and navy. For the
former he reintroduced a system which Gustavus Adolphus
had applied, the so-called <i>Indelningsverk</i> (work of division),
which, elaborated upon and firmly established by
Charles XI., became the foundation of the Swedish army
system. The whole country was divided into small sections,
which were each to support an infantry soldier, or a sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>man,
and larger ones to support a cavalry soldier. This
soldier received a hamlet with earth to till within his section,
paying for it by work to the farmers or squires, while
these paid for his equipment. In times of war the state
paid his expenses. This changed the troublesome army
element into useful members of state in times of peace.
The officers were given small estates by the crown for their
support. The army consisted, at the death of Charles XI.,
of 65,000 men, well equipped. On the coast of Bleking
extensive navy yards were built by Count Hans Wachtmeister
and Eric Dahlberg, in a new town called Carlscrona.
At great expense, the best fleet ever under Swedish
command was constructed by Wachtmeister, who enjoyed the
full confidence of the king. His excellent means wherewith
to conduct a successful war, Charles XI. used to maintain
a dignified peace, of which his country was badly in need.
Bengt Oxenstierna held the reins of diplomacy, which had
no attraction for Charles XI. The old alliance with France
was broken off and close connections with William of
Orange established for the maintenance of peace. Sweden
regained its prestige, rising to a power whose support was
sought by all. When William became king of England,
Sweden was a member of the alliance against Louis XIV.,
but contributed to the great European war only a few thousand
soldiers, according to agreement, preserving, together
with Denmark, an armed neutrality. Charles XI. lived
to the proud moment when the powers selected Sweden as
an arbiter in the deliberations for peace in Riswick, a
worthy satisfaction gained over the earlier insolence of
Louis XIV.</p>

<p>Charles XI. improved the administration by filling the
offices of the excellent institutions with excellent men. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
he obtained by enforcing the necessity of obeying orders,
supplying officials of all ranks, from the lowest upward,
with new regulations which must be obeyed, also regulating
their salaries. Sweden never had a greater lover of law
and order than Charles XI., and he used his absolute power
in their interests, trying to remold the old laws to suit modern
requirements, and having a new church law, a masterpiece
in its line, introduced. The church itself and its men
had in Charles XI. an interested friend. New catechism,
hymn book and ritual were prepared, and a new translation
of the Bible completed, being published after his death.
Commerce and mining industries were encouraged, while
agriculture improved with the improvement of the financial
conditions of the peasants. Charles XI. was not
only a “peace king,” but a “peasant king,” who was
ardently devoted to the improvement of the education and
financial circumstances of the country population. He was
of broadly democratic inclinations, finding his delight in
moving among the humble and lowly as one of them. The
peasants, who had been brushed aside by the great and
powerful, were now brought to the front and took an
active and important part in the affairs of state. Charles
ruled over them with a stern husbandry, and asked great
sacrifices of them for the maintenance of an armed defence;
but no king has accomplished more in their true interest
than he, or remains more clearly in their memory and traditions.
He travelled continually through the country, avoiding
the places where he would be received with ceremony,
stopping in the houses of the farmers, and enjoying heartily
what comfort these offered. In his appearance he was
far from prepossessing. His features were not devoid of
beauty, but gloomy; his figure strong and vigorous, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
not impressive. Through an accident while hunting he
became slightly lame. Although dearth and hard times
set in during the last years of his reign, causing terrible
losses of life through hunger and prostration, he could
plainly tell the beneficent results of his administration.
Charles XI. took the reins of state when disastrous war
ravished a country which seemed doomed to destruction.
He left it reformed, reorganized, rejuvenated and prosperous
at his death, in 1697.</p>

<p>The Period of Political Grandeur in Swedish history
falls within the epoch of the history of art which has been
called <i>Barocco</i>, an unbalanced offspring of the Renaissance,
and a style characterized by great complicity, pretensions
and ambitions, a renaissance in wigs of formidable proportions.
After the great victories of the Thirty Years’ War,
it seems as if the interchange of influences between art,
literature, science, politics and religion was increased. The
whole era becomes a Barocco period of bombast and chauvinism,
the climax being reached in the form of the absolute
monarchy of the age.</p>

<p>In Sweden, as elsewhere, there was no lack of men of
ability and brilliant genius; but, influenced by the spirit
of their time, the works of most of them were bombastic
and chauvinistic, like the artistic and political aspirations
of the era. The artists were, as were at first the scholars,
mostly foreigners. The native and imported scholars
were characterized by great learning and versatility, but
abused their genius by Utopian theories and vainglorious
dreams, and violated the laws of history and sound
research.</p>

<p>Olof Rudbeck was not only the most learned and brilliantly
gifted scholar of his day, but his genius also embod<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>ies
the eccentricities of the period in gigantic outlines. He
was born at Westeros, in 1630, his father being the learned
bishop, Johannes Rudbeckius. As a boy, he gave evidence
of rare artistic and mechanic talents. He made
drawings of exquisite designs, constructed clock mechanisms
of wood, and was a skilled musician. His character
was proud and violent. At sixteen he was through with
his college course and ready to enter the university. The
youth could not stand the change from his coarse jacket
and fur coat into a coat of broadcloth with buttons such
as the students wore, and was for his overbearing manner
punished by his severe father with an additional year of
college work. At the University of Upsala he caused from
the start great surprise by his knowledge in all subjects.
He devoted his attention chiefly to natural science, which,
in that day, was a neglected study, and soon excelled his
professors.</p>

<p>At twenty, Rudbeck made a scientific discovery of great
importance, which caused a stir in the whole learned world.
By his discovery and theory of the lymphatic ducts, the
blood circulation of the human body received a satisfactory
explanation. Before the circle of scholars which surrounded
Queen Christine, Rudbeck was allowed to demonstrate his
anatomical discoveries, in 1652. Queen Christine, who
earlier had been an admirer of his beautiful voice and
musical abilities, loaded him with praise and gave him the
means for a journey abroad. Rudbeck returned, in 1660,
to Sweden, and was appointed professor of medicine at the
University of Upsala. He planned the first botanic garden
in the country, donating it to the university. He had illustrations
made of the native plants and commenced a learned
work on botany. The first hall of anatomy was erected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
according to his proposition. As rector of the university,
he established several important reforms, in spite of opposition,
but supported by the chancellor, Magnus Gabriel de la
Gardie, who was his friend and protector. To the stupendous
mastery of all sciences, Rudbeck added a skill and
cleverness in various branches of practical activity which
made him carry, with honor, the nickname of “master at
all trades.” He was an excellent financier, who succeeded
in restoring the sound economy of the university. He built
a fish pond, from which the tables of the learned professors
were regularly supplied with fish. A book store and a book-printing
establishment were erected by him, and for a time
run at his expense. He repaired windmills, built houses,
provided the university town with water works and street
pavement, also arranging its postal service. Rudbeck was
one of the finest composers and singers of his day, conducting
the musical exercises at the university. He made fireworks
and compasses for the Swedish navy, built fountains
and organs, was a good poet and painter and an excellent
etcher and drawer.</p>

<p>Rudbeck does not owe his great renown to his mastery
of any of these trades, arts or sciences, nor to any discovery,
reform or invention by his versatile genius. It was his
monumental work, “Atland or Manheim,” generally called
“The Atlantica,” which made him world-famous. For
centuries one had believed in the statement made by Jordanes,
and based upon traditions current among his people,
that the Goths who conquered Rome had migrated from the
North, and that their ancestors, from the remotest period,
were inhabitants of Sweden. Johannes Magnus constructed
a line of Swedish kings, beginning with Magog,
the son of Japhet, on the basis of which the sons of Gus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>tavus
Vasa, Eric XIV., and Charles IX., had accepted
their high ordinals. In the time of Rudbeck it was considered
a supremely praiseworthy effort to glorify the fatherland
by strengthening its claims to a high antiquity. Rudbeck,
the remarkable savant and able poet, got his head
turned by the political grandeur of his country. He had
in his youth read the story of Atlantis, found in Plato.
Rudbeck undertook to prove, in “The Atlantica,” that the
lost island, with its ancient ideal state from which the gods
of antiquity were supposed to hail, was identical with Sweden.
The work, in four large volumes, was written in Swedish
and Latin of parallel columns. The first volume was
printed in 1675, Rudbeck having made the types himself.
In Sweden the work was greeted with an enthusiasm which
had no bounds. The second volume was published by
funds which Charles XI. with great generosity placed at
the author’s disposal. The third volume was dedicated
to the youthful Charles XII., a true child of the chauvinistic
epoch, who hailed the book with delight. The fourth
volume was in press when Upsala was destroyed by fire,
in 1702. The aged Rudbeck led the battle against the
ravaging element, by supreme exertions saving the university
halls, at the expense of his home, his press and
manuscripts, and the rest of the town. Rudbeck died in
the autumn of the same year.</p>

<p>The elaborate construction which Rudbeck had completed
by means of ingenious deductions and learned guesswork
succumbed with the political grandeur of Sweden.
“The Atlantica,” which once had its place beside the Bible
on the tables of the mighty ones, was ridiculed and forgotten.
On the continent of Europe, where similar books
had been written in Germany and Holland, making for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
these respective countries similar claims, “The Atlantica”
was at first received with surprise and admiration, later
with doubt and criticism. The work, in spite of its mistakes,
proved a foundation for archæological research, which
gradually was developed into a science. In order to support
the boldest and most impossible theories, the almost
unparalleled power of combination of an eminent genius
has brought together material which for the first time gave
the suggestion of relationship between the Teutonic and the
classical languages of Greece and Rome. Rudbeck was
also the first to point out the unmistakable resemblance of
the Old Norse and classical mythologies, as to the origin
of which modern scholars have reached no absolute certainty,
but radically different conclusions. The importance
which Rudbeck placed upon popular customs and traditions
was too great, but it has favorably influenced later students
of ethnography and folk lore.</p>

<p>If Rudbeck had limited himself to the demonstration that
Sweden has been not the cradle of all races, but the original
home of the Teutonic branch of the Aryan race, he might
have been able to offer a theory, the truth of which modern
science lacks, and forever may lack, the resources to
disprove.</p>

<p>Rudbeck had not been entirely without opponents in
Sweden. The most noted among them was John Peringskiold,
who criticised the opinion expressed by Rudbeck that
the Runes were the oldest alphabet of the world. Peringskiold
was a fine Icelandic scholar, and the first editor of
Snorre Sturleson’s “Heimskringla.”</p>

<p>A typical and highly valuable illustrated work from this
period is the “Svecia Antiqua et Hodierna,” by Eric Dahlberg,
the renowned quartermaster of Charles X. The text,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
written by Dahlberg and translated into Latin by several
scholars, was never published, the magnificent engravings
not before 1716. The latter give an impressive portrayal
of architectural Sweden during the reigns of the three
Charleses, but are not quite reliable, as some of the
castles and palaces in this work are provided with additions
and embellishments which were never more than
projected.</p>

<p>There is no family who has wielded a greater influence
over the Swedish church than that of Benzelius. The
founder of the house, Eric Benzelius the Elder, and three
of his sons were archbishops of Sweden, and two of his
grandsons bishops of the state church. The first Archbishop
Benzelius, born in 1632, was the son of a peasant,
and took his name from the farm of Bentseby, of Lulea
parish, in Norrland, where he was born; he and the three
of his seven sons who were archbishops refused to be
ennobled, the other members of the family adopting the
name of Benzelstierna. The earlier generations of the
family produced men of great talent and power, to whom
the third one, although consisting of able men, could not
be compared. The influence of this family in matters of
religion, science and culture was strongly felt during the
period of more than one century. The most remarkable
member was Eric Benzelius the Younger, one of the most
learned, active and patriotic men ever born in Sweden.
Like the other members of the family, he perfected his
education at foreign universities and made the personal
acquaintance of Leibnitz, Thomasius, Malebranche, and
other celebrated scholars. He was a historian, literary
critic and philologist of merit, writing a history of Sweden
and preparing an edition of Codex Argenteus, published<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
in London after his death. He was highly appreciated by
Charles XII., and was a friend of Polhem and Swedenborg,
being married to a sister of the latter. Eric Benzelius was
appointed archbishop, but died, in 1742, before he had
entered office.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Period of Political Grandeur&mdash;Charles XII</i></span></h2>

<p>Charles XII., the most famous of Swedish kings,
was a boy of fifteen at the death of his father. He
was born June 17, 1682, at the castle of Stockholm.
The astrologers declared that Sweden was to receive a new
war-lord, and that time they were not mistaken. Charles
XII. was born in the same year as the absolute monarchy
of Sweden, which power he was to abuse in such a great
measure. Shortly after his birth, one of the speakers of the
knightly chapter house, Justice Gyllencreutz, said while
warning against the consequences of an absolute power:
“A king may come who follows his own will, being more
fond of war than peace, or utterly extravagant. History
proves that changes of the constitution generally are beset
by dangerous consequences; yea, that they often have
brought destruction to the country and its people.” These
words were prophetic.</p>

<p>The early education of Charles was supervised by his
mother, sweet Ulrica Eleonore, who taught him piety,
modesty, gentleness and justice by her own example. He
participated with earnestness in the morning and evening
prayers, kneeling before the only Lord he ever acknowledged
as his superior. His mother died when Charles was
seven years of age, but the devotion in which he held her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
he fixed upon his sisters, Hedvig Sophie and Ulrica Eleonore,
but especially upon the former. His religious feeling
was deep and sincere, and he evinced early a love of truth,
justice and pure morals which, like his brotherly devotion,
followed him through life. The most remarkable trait in
a son of Charles XI. was his power of self-control; but he
was his father’s superior also in intellectual gifts, such
as a ready memory, a good apprehension and a sharp discernment.
His faults were early developed, and met, after
the death of his parents, no restraint. He was taciturn,
unapproachable, proud, self-willed and headstrong. He had
from his grandfather inherited an ambition for the vain
glory of war, which was led astray by his unrestrained power
of imagination. From the age of five he was taught by the
learned professor, Andreas Norcopensis, ennobled under the
name of Nordenhielm, to whom he was very devoted and
under whose guidance he received a good general education.
The plain, able scholar influenced the young prince
in a wholesome manner. When his teacher asked him how
an honest man ought to be, the pupil, then seven years of
age, answered: “He should be gentle but of great courage;
fierce like a lion to his enemies, gentle like a lamb to those
at home.” To the question if it were not better to avoid
dangers in order to save one’s life, the little Charles answered:
“No, it would be a shame to live in such a
manner.”</p>

<p>Charles XI. had drawn an outline of the course which
the education of his son was to follow. The first place
was given to study of the Bible and the Christian doctrines
and the severe practice of religion. The prince was to
learn Swedish and German early, to receive instruction
in the laws and constitution of his country, and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
science of war, and to be trained in the arts of military
drill, fencing and riding on horseback. He soon acquired
the faculty of speaking Latin fluently, in the ordinary
mechanical way, and learned some French. When his
first governor, Eric Lindskiold, tried to interest him in the
latter language by pointing out its usefulness in diplomatic
intercourse with the French ambassador, the prince answered:
“If I meet the king of France I will converse with
him in his own language. When a French ambassador
comes here, it is more appropriate that he learns Swedish
on my account than I French on his.” His favorite studies
were strategy and mathematics, which he made under
the Swedish general, Charles Magnus Stuart. He often
said that the one who was ignorant of mathematics was
only a half human being. Charles was fond of riding the
horses of his father, and followed the latter on his adventurous
journeys and hunts. When only twelve years of age
he killed his first bear. He early developed the reckless
courage which made him so famous. Charles was exceedingly
fond of reading the Eddic poems and the old hero
Sagas of the North. He said he wanted to resemble the
ancient hero kings, and wished he had, like many of them,
a brother who would remain at home to rule the country
in peace, while he, with his warriors, made a tour of the
world. The prescription, made by his father, that the
prince should be taught to make a moderate use of his
absolute power, was, if carried out, of little consequence.
Charles mourned deeply the losses of his mother and of his
first teacher, Nordenhielm, which followed close upon each
other, seeking, after that, more the company of his father.
Charles XI. had a long private conversation with his son
shortly before his death, pointing out the men in whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
he could confide. Among these Charles Piper occupied
a conspicuous place. He remained ever the adviser of
Charles XII., but never had his full confidence. The enigmatic
king confided in nobody, and passed through life
without opening his heart to any one.</p>

<p>Charles XI. had appointed a government to reign during
the minority of his son, to be presided over by Queen-dowager
Hedvig Eleonore. But the Estates of the Riksdag,
at the request of the nobility, declared Charles XII.
of age when only fifteen. The young king placed the crown
upon his head with his own hands at the coronation, and
took charge of the government in November, 1697. Bengt
Oxenstierna remained at the head of foreign affairs as the
president of the chancery, while Charles took personal
interest in continuing the life work of his father, the
restitution of crown lands, which still went on. Charles
Piper, who had been quite active in obtaining an early
majority for the king, was raised to the dignity of a count,
and became one of the most influential members of the state
council. Charles was not influenced by anybody in spite
of his youth. He listened to what the councillors had to
say, then announced his resolutions with terse independence.
He refused firmly the appeals of the nobility to reduce
the demands of the work of restitution. He abolished
the practice of torture, in spite of the unanimous vote of the
state council to the contrary. When the aged Bengt Oxenstierna
was anxious to have annulled a treaty with France, already
signed, the young king answered tersely: “You have
heard my opinion; I am the one who signed the treaty.”
Charles took, in general, little interest in foreign affairs,
except those concerning Holstein, to the duke of which
country his elder sister was married.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>The exuberant spirits of the youthful Charles found an
outlet in daring exploits and plays of war. The somewhat
older man, Count Arvid Bernhard Horn, the commander of
the royal body-guard, took an active part in these as the
most intimate comrade of the king. They went bear-hunting
together, with wooden forks as their only weapon, fought
naval battles with hand-spurts, made breakneck rides on
horseback, etc. When the king was near being drowned
in one of these “naval battles,” the only ones that Charles
XII. ever fought, he was saved by Arvid Horn, who pulled
him up by the hair. When Horn in some other game was
badly hurt and taken ill, the king kept the night watch at
his bedside. Upon the visits of Duke Frederic of Holstein,
the two young princes indulged in escapades of the wildest
kind, if one were to believe the reports made by the foreign
ambassadors at Stockholm to their respective governments,
and chiefly founded upon hearsay. His application to state
affairs was almost constant and very arduous, for which
reason these reports of the escapades and adventures of the
youthful king are probably wild exaggerations, or mere
fables.</p>

<p>The reports of a young inexperienced king who gave
up his time to sport and pastimes spread abroad, and the
enemies of Sweden were led to believe that an opportune
moment was come for an attack on the empire which held
the balance of power in Northern Europe. Peter the Great,
one of the most remarkable men of modern history, was
czar of Russia. Engaged in his heroic task of reorganizing
his barbarous empire to a modern European state, he was
desirous of obtaining harbors on the coast of the Baltic,
from which sea he was cut off by the Swedish possessions.
August, a cousin of Charles XII., who was elector of Sax<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>ony
and king of Poland, was anxious to take possession
of Livonia. King Frederic IV. of Denmark, also a cousin of
Charles, wished to suppress the duke of Holstein, who had
gained independence, thanks to the assistance of Sweden.
Czar Peter and King August entered into a secret alliance
with each other. While negotiations for continued peace with
Sweden were still pending, the Russians secretly crossed
the boundary in Ingermanland, Saxon troops entered Livonia,
and the king of Denmark took possession of Holstein.
The Swedish council of state was amazed at this
triple danger. Charles simply remarked that it was strange
that both of his cousins wanted war, and expressed the hope
that God would support him in his righteous cause.</p>

<p>Charles XII. was eighteen years of age when he entered
this stupendous conflict. He was tall and slender, but
broad-shouldered; he had a sympathetic face, dark-blue
eyes, thin brown hair, and a carriage expressing courage
and an indomitable spirit. Upon entering actual warfare,
Charles renounced all pleasures and comforts. Sharing the
severe discipline of his soldiers, he slept in a tent, ate of
their rude food, and drank nothing but water. The wig,
considered so indispensable in those days, was laid aside
and he dressed, like the men of his body-guard, in a coat
of coarse blue cloth with large brass buttons and yellow
lining. His long sword was hung at a yellow leather
girdle. He wore high boots and yellow trousers made
of skin. In battle he was always found where the danger
was most imminent.</p>

<p>Charles turned first against Denmark. A Swedish fleet
of forty-eight ships joined the naval forces of equal strength
which the Swedish allies, England and Holland, had sent
to meet it in the Sound. A more powerful combination has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
never been seen before or after in Scandinavian waters.
Charles embarked with his troops on one hundred Scanian
ships and landed at Elsinore, August 4, 1699. He was
impatient to reach shore, jumped into the water, which
reached to his arms, and was followed by his troops,
who carried their weapons high above the water. A sudden
attack was made on the Danish troops on shore, who
turned and fled. The Swedes made a temporary camp
and prepared themselves for a march on Copenhagen.
King Frederic was struck with terror and hastened to
make peace with the duke of Holstein, who was left in
undisturbed possession of his country through the treaty
of peace at Traventhal. Charles withdrew his troops at
once, although reluctantly, having wished to crush the
power of Denmark. He had maintained the strictest discipline
in his camp, and treated the inhabitants of the country
with gentleness. The Danish peasants, who abundantly
brought necessary provisions, said to the king: “You do
us no harm because you are the son of our pious Ulrica
Eleonore.” The king answered: “What I have done I
have been forced to do. But rest assured that I shall from
this day be the upright friend of your king.”</p>

<p>Charles now turned against Russia. With an army of
somewhat more than 8,000 men he sailed for Ingermanland
to attack the invaders, at least five times as many in numbers,
who were laying siege to the town of Narva. The
majority of the Russian troops consisted of serfs who were
taken directly from their work and were without any military
training. This army of undisciplined serfs was to
a great extent commanded by foreign adventurers. The
news of the approach of the Swedish troops brought consternation.
Several of the Russian officers shed tears, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
the czar quickly left his army to gather more troops. The
remarkable battle of Narva was fought November 20, 1700.
King Charles offered the enemies a battle in the open field,
but when they refused to accept or to come out, he attacked
them in their trenches, which formed a semi-circle around
the town of Narva, with the wings touching the river of the
same name. The war-cry of the Swedes was: “With the
help of God!” Their attack was favored by a snowstorm,
which blew in the faces of the Russians, blinding them. The
enemies could tell that the Swedes were few in numbers,
but thought that reinforcements must be on the way. The
trenches were filled with bundles of fagots, the ramparts
were mounted, and the Russians thrown into confusion.
The Russian cavalry fled at the opening of the artillery fire.
The rest, crushed in between the walls of the town and their
aggressors, tried to escape on every side. The Swedes soon
had cut the immense Russian line of troops in twain at the
centre. The half which consisted of the right wing moved
down to the bridge over the Narva River. But the bridge
gave way under the weight of the first 3,000 men, who
found their graves in the river below. The rest of the right
wing was hedged in between the Swedes and the river.
The regiments of the Russian guards, who were the most
experienced of the troops, fought bravely for some time,
but great confusion ensued among the others, the soldiers
wanting to kill their foreign officers, whom they blamed for
the catastrophe. The chief commander, Duke de Croi, with
several other foreigners, for this reason surrendered to the
king.</p>

<p>The Russian soldiers of the right wing, abandoned by
their superior officers, made heroic efforts to defend themselves
behind barricades which they erected for the mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>ment.
King Charles hastened to the spot, but was very
near losing his life in passing through a swamp. He sank
so deep that the water rose to his neck, and he could save
himself only by leaving his horse, his sword, and one of his
heavy boots behind in the mud. Without in the least improving
his condition, the king took another horse and
sought his way to the heart of the battle. The Russians
were killed in masses, but did not surrender before King
Charles had taken a Russian battery, thus depriving them
of the last hope of being reunited with the left wing. The
latter, who kept in the vicinity of their trenches, had fought
with a good deal of courage. At nightfall two officers
were sent from the right wing to ask the king for an
armistice, which was granted. King Charles spent the
night in his wet clothes, by the bivouac fire, on the ground,
his head resting in the lap of one of his soldiers. In the
morning, before dawn, two Russian generals arrived, demanding
free leave for the remainder of the right wing.
This was granted, but the superior officers had to remain
as prisoners of war. The commander of the left wing also
opened negotiations. Free leave was granted them upon
the surrender of their arms. It must have been an impressive
sight to see the body of 12,000 Russians, with
heads uncovered, who passed in line by only half as many
Swedes, depositing their banners and arms at the feet of
Charles XII. It was a wise plan to keep as prisoners only
the superior officers, for the Swedes had not the means at
hand to watch and feed so many prisoners as those who
were allowed a free leave. In the battle of Narva 18,000
Russians were killed or captured; the hostile camp, baggage
and artillery fell into the hands of the victors.
Charles XII. made his solemn entry into Narva, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
Te Deum was sung in the cathedral. Charles with his own
hand crossed out all expressions of vainglory over the success
or disdain of the vanquished which occurred in the
official account of the victory to be sent to Stockholm.</p>

<p>In the following year Charles XII. turned against his
third enemy, King August. Saxon troops, 10,000 strong,
were joined by 19,000 Russians, and had taken a strongly
fortified position on the southern shore of the river Dvina.
Charles decided to cross the river from Livonia and attack
the enemy. The famous crossing of the Dvina was planned
in all details by Eric Dahlberg, the venerable hero and
engineer from the wars of Charles X. and Charles XI.
Baron Dahlberg died not long after this memorable event.
It was June 27, 1701. The Swedish infantry was carried
across in prams, the cavalry on fleet-bridges provided with
wooden walls on hinges, which, when erect, were a protection
against the fire of the enemy, and, when let down,
formed gangways for the landing. In front of all boats
loaded with hay and straw were sent out, which were
ignited, sending a thick, disagreeable smoke in the face of
the enemy. The artillery in the prams kept up a disastrous
fire. Charles XII. was one of the first to land, and opened
the attack when only half of his infantry had reached the
shore. The Russians soon scattered in wild flight. The
Saxons withstood three powerful attacks, but at last followed
the bad example set by their allies. The battle was
fought and won before the Swedish cavalry had reached
the shore. The bountiful provisions of the scattered army
were captured. The crossing of the Dvina was executed
under the direction of Charles Magnus Stuart and Count
Magnus Stenbock.</p>

<p>The victories of the young hero king and his valiant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
soldiers aroused the admiration of all Europe, and much
sympathy was expressed for Sweden, who had so successfully
warded off a deceitful and unjust attack. Charles
XII. received offers of peace from his enemies, but he did
not accept them. He did not believe that his treacherous
neighbors would keep their promises, and he was no doubt
right. He ought to have crushed Russia first, but his victory
over Czar Peter had been too easily acquired to make
him realize the genius, power and resources of this semi-barbarous
enemy. Charles considered King August a more
formidable opponent, which was a mistake; but his suspicion
that the latter would attack him from behind if he
entered Russia would probably have proved to be well
founded had circumstances permitted. So Charles invaded
Poland, resolved to gain by the interior conflict which was
disturbing the peace of that country. He wanted to dethrone
August and select a prince who would keep faith
with Sweden.</p>

<p>The Polish empire had not taken any active part in the
war against Sweden, but Charles XII. demanded that the
Poles should prove their good faith by dethroning August
and by choosing a native king. When they refused, he let
his army enter Poland. For four years King Charles remained
there, marching from one part of the country to the
other. He conquered the Polish capitals of Warsaw and
Cracow, and several other fortified places, winning over
a considerable group within the nobility. In 1704 the Diet
of Warsaw was called, at which the Polish nobles, in the
presence of Swedish troops under the command of Count
Arvid Horn, were compelled to deprive August of his
crown and elect a new king according to the instructions
of King Charles. The new king chosen was the noble, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
incapable Stanislav Leczinski, who belonged to an aristocratic
family of little influence and few connections. He
was an upright and highly educated man, but lacked energy.
King August was not willing to abdicate, for which
reason King Charles pursued him into his hereditary land.
The line of march to Saxony went through Silesia, a neutral
country belonging to the empire of Austria. As the
army of August had been allowed to pass this country,
Charles argued that the same right must be granted him
and his troops. At the river Oder, Charles was met by
a number of persecuted Protestants, who, kneeling and
weeping, prayed for his assistance in pleading their cause
before the emperor. Charles promised them to do so, and
kept his word.</p>

<p>The Swedish army entered Saxony in the year 1706.
The inhabitants, who had in a clear memory the acts of recklessness
and cruelty committed by the troops of John Banér,
fled for their lives, taking along all the property that could
be moved. To their great surprise, they saw the Swedes
encamp themselves as quietly as in time of serenest peace.
No violence was committed. Nothing was taken, except
in exchange for money. But a heavy war tax was imposed,
which made both August and his people inclined to seek an
early end of the war.</p>

<p>Thanks to the means raised in this manner, the Swedish
army was provided with an entirely new outfit of clothes
and furnished with necessary provisions. Every regiment
established a savings bank of its own, in which the soldiers
deposited their earnings. The castle of Alt-Ranstædt was
the headquarters of Charles XII., situated close by the
memorable battlefield of Lutzen. The sojourn of Charles
XII. in Saxony was an incident of universal importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
to the history of Europe. He had with his soldiers approached
the scene of a conflict which was shaking the
whole of Western and Southern Europe. The situation
was such that it for the moment hung at the point of the
victorious sword of Charles XII. The great question was
whether he was resolved to take an active part in the universal
conflict. Charles was besieged at his headquarters
by princes, warriors and statesmen, who came to pay their
respects, desirous of winning his favor and of getting an
idea of his plans. The Swedish invasion of Saxony was
highly beneficial to the interests of France, and Louis XIV.
was the first to admit it, anxious to make the stay of
Charles as long as possible, because it had caused a standstill
in the hostilities against France. The Duke of Marlborough
was among the visitors of Charles XII. He
brought a letter of courtesy from Queen Anne, who wrote
that the letter “came not from her chancery but from her
heart, and was written by her own hand.” She longed
to meet the famous king personally. The duke’s errand was
to find out whether Charles was to join the fighting forces
of Western Europe or to attack Russia. He was glad to
learn that the latter move was the one which the king had
in mind. Although the two great warriors expressed mutual
admiration, neither was sympathetically impressed by
the other. Charles XII. thought Marlborough looked “too
fine” for a soldier, while the latter thought the rude simplicity
of the king an affectation by which to obtain notoriety.
On account of the great influx of distinguished visitors,
the style of living was quite different at the royal
headquarters of Alt-Ranstædt to what it was during the
Polish and Russian wars. But the king kept up the heavy
military drills and long individual expeditions on horseback,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
which he thought indispensable. One of the first ones of
the latter which he undertook was to visit the battlefield
of Lutzen. The king remembered distinctly all that he
had read about the famous battle, and made clear to his
generals the various positions of the two armies. At
Schwedenstein, the place where Gustavus Adolphus fell,
he lingered for a long while in silence. At last he said:
“I always have tried to live as he did. May God grant
me the grace of dying in like manner.”</p>

<p>King August was satisfied to conclude a treaty of peace,
which was signed at Alt-Ranstædt. He renounced the
crown of Poland and recognized Stanislav Leczinski as
the legitimate king. August turned over John Reinhold
Patkul, a Livonian traitor, who during the reign of
Charles XI. had made himself disagreeably conspicuous,
and who had been intriguing against Sweden ever since.
Charles XII. was, in gentleness and justice, far in advance
of his contemporaries, but he made an exception to his
ordinary course of clemency in the case of Patkul, who
was executed according to the cruel practice of the time.
When the Swedish army left their camp, after peace was
made, the regiments were for many miles followed by the
grateful inhabitants, who, with tears in their eyes, gave
evidence of their friendship. The reason was that the good-natured
soldiers of the regular army had followed the habits
of their country in assisting their temporary hosts in their
various rural pursuits. The Swedes were greeted by the
people of Silesia with great enthusiasm, out of gratitude for
the improved conditions which the emperor had granted
them, at the request of the king. Charles XII. thus
made good, in a measure, the acts of violence committed
by the Swedish army during the Thirty Years’ War,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
and proved that he had at heart the cause of religious
liberty.</p>

<p>Czar Peter was now to be punished, when it was too
late. The Russians had invaded the Baltic provinces and
captured the fortress of Nœteborg, which Czar Peter gave
the new and significant name of Schluesselburg. The new
Russian capital of St. Petersburg, with formidable fortresses,
was founded in 1703. The laborers were carried
away by force from the various parts of the immense empire.
They died in great numbers of prostration and of
fevers, the Swedes also doing their best to impede the
progress of the work. The vacancies were rapidly filled
by new multitudes. While the Swedish king was fighting
in Poland, the provinces of Ingermanland, Esthonia and
Livonia were overrun by the Russians, who devastated the
country with acts of cruelty. Dorpat was captured and
Narva fell after a bloody conflict, being bravely defended
by Rudolph Horn. The Russians destroyed the Swedish
navy of the Lake Peipus and penetrated to the province
of Courland where Charles XII. had left a considerable
detachment of troops. The plan of Czar Peter to conquer
Courland and cut off Charles from the connections with his
empire was frustrated by General Adam Louis Lewenhaupt.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
He met a formidable Russian force, several times
as numerous as his own, at Gemauerthof, near Mitau,
which he routed, in 1705.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>Sweden stood alone in her struggle with Russia. The
old alliance with England and Holland was no longer in
existence. The continental powers were too busily engaged
in the West to assist in checking the rising power of the
Eastern giant. For the limited resources of Sweden he was
too big already. Charles XII. had with him a stately and
well-equipped army of 44,000, which, by contemporary
authors, was pronounced to have consisted of the finest
soldiers of the world. Charles was to attack Russia from
Poland, for the devastated Baltic provinces could no longer
support an army with the necessary provisions. General
Lewenhaupt was to join him from Livonia with an army
of 12,000 men and ample provisions. Another Swedish
commander, General Lybecker, was to attack and destroy
St. Petersburg, with an army of the same size, from his
headquarters in Finland. The total of Swedish troops distributed
in various directions amounted to 100,000, the
largest regular army Sweden ever had put up. Charles
had concluded to engage semi-barbarous allies in a battle
against a semi-barbarous enemy. In 1707 he entered
into an alliance with Turkey, and, about the same
time, another with Mazeppa, an old ambitious Cossack
leader who wanted to establish his supremacy over the
steppes of Russia. The plans of Charles XII. for the invasion
of Russia have often been severely criticised, but
competent judges of our day have declared that they were
not only elaborate but highly ingenious. They miscarried
on account of arrangements which could not be made according
to expectations, and on account of Czar Peter’s practice
of laying bare and waste the parts of his own country
through which the invaders were to pass. Furthermore,
Charles had sent home to Sweden several of his best gen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>erals,
such as Arvid Horn and Magnus Stenbock. This
was done after the successes in Poland, and was a good
thing in itself, for the men mentioned were exactly those
who were destined to save the very existence and honor
of a country which was deprived of its political grandeur
through the heedlessness of King Charles. But without
them he was surrounded by inexperienced men only.
Charles Gustavus Rehnskiold was the most conspicuous
of these, a valiant but reckless man, who only understood
certain details of the elaborate expedition.</p>

<p>When the Swedes were approaching Russian territory,
Czar Peter made offers of peace which the French ambassador
urged Charles to accept. Charles answered: “He
does not mean it. He wishes the world to believe that he
wants peace and I war.” Czar Peter had organized his
army through a wonderful exertion of energy, built new
fortresses and strengthened the old ones, enforced discipline
and gathered ammunition. Able officers had been trained
in the repeated conflicts with the Swedes. These took the
lead of the army movements.</p>

<p>Charles left Poland with somewhat more than 30,000
men, entering Lithuania and chasing the Russians before
him. A last great victory was won by Charles XII. at
Holovzin in Lithuania, in 1708. The Swedish army crossed
the Dniepr and marched to Mohilev. Charles lingered in
this place for a month, anxiously awaiting the arrival of
General Lewenhaupt. The latter remained in Livonia during
all this time, the letter ordering him to join the central
army not reaching him in due time. The march was continued
toward Smolensk, but King Charles thought that he
could only reach Moscow over that route with the greatest
difficulty, and changed his course, marching toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
Ukraine to join Mazeppa and the Tartars. Mazeppa had
been vexed by the long delay, and was, besides, not able
to gather the forces which he had promised. Czar Peter
captured his stronghold, and Mazeppa reached the Swedish
army more like a fugitive than an ally. The expedition
of General Lybecker against St. Petersburg proved a failure.
Lewenhaupt, who had at last received his order,
moved into Russia. At Liesna he met a hostile army considerably
larger than his own. After a fierce battle, which
involved a great loss of life, Lewenhaupt broke through the
Russian lines. He had been forced to destroy the great
amount of provisions which he had gathered, and reached
the army of King Charles in a very different state than was
anticipated. The king found himself in a difficult position,
being cut off from all connections with his country and in
want of provisions.</p>

<p>The battle of Pultowa, which was fought June 28, 1709,
decided for centuries the contest over the political supremacy
of Northern Europe. Charles XII., with his army,
which had been reduced to 18,000 men, laid siege to the
important town of Pultowa, by the river Vorskla. The
Russian army, 50,000 strong, under the command of Czar
Peter, hastened toward the enemy. The fear of the terrible
Swedes was as yet so strong in them that they did not
risk an attack, but built a strongly fortified camp. King
Charles, with his army in distress, further reduced to only
12,000 men, and in want even of ammunition, saw no other
way than to fight. He was himself wounded in the foot
and unable to take command in person. General Rehnskiold,
who led the cavalry, acted as general commander
during the battle, which position he was not able to fill;
Lewenhaupt commanded the right wing with decided suc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>cess.
He forced the enemy to abandon three of its seven
forts, and saw it once inclined to leave in flight. The left
wing of the Swedish army was brought into disorder and
receded. King Charles, who suffered greatly from his
wounded foot, was carried on a litter between the lines,
encouraging his soldiers and dealing out new orders. The
litter was soon shattered, and the horse which the king
mounted was shot under him. He saved himself by accepting
the horse of one of his officers. Rehnskiold, who appeared
nervous and confused, offered only a lame assistance
with the cavalry. While riding back and forth in his heedless
anxiety to be useful, without obtaining his object, he
rode into the Russian lines and was made a prisoner. The
same fate befell Count Piper, the aged adviser of King
Charles. Lewenhaupt kept up his heroic struggle on the
right wing, but his forces were greatly reduced by the fire
of the Russian artillery. The Swedes had lost the battle.
Their infantry had especially suffered great losses. A great
number of the ablest officers were killed or made prisoners.
As an illustration may be quoted the fact that among the
killed were twenty-two officers of the Wrangel family.
The Russians made no fierce pursuit, and the remnants of
the Swedish army were given time to recede to the shore
of the Dniepr where this river is joined by the Vorskla.
The change of route toward the Ukraine had been made
contrary to the advice of Count Piper; the march to the
Dniepr was made contrary to that of Count Lewenhaupt.
The Swedish troops were in fact shut in between the mighty
rivers, which they lacked the means to cross, and the
surrounding mountains, lined with Russian artillery.
Charles was unwilling to leave his army, but Lewenhaupt
persuaded him to save his life. Mazeppa had crossed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
Dniepr with his troops. Charles followed in the night of
July 1st with 1,000 of his men. With 500 Swedes Charles
reached the Turkish town of Bender, where he was at first
resolved to remain only until his wound was healed. Lewenhaupt,
who now was in command, surrendered to the
Russians the following morning, with all the rest of the
army. This course was inevitable; another battle would
only have caused new and useless sacrifices of human lives.</p>

<p>A sad fate awaited the Swedes in Russian captivity.
Only a few saw their homes again, after years of suffering.
Rehnskiold was among these. The majority, like Lewenhaupt
and Piper, died in captivity. Considerable information
about the experiences of the Swedish prisoners in
Russia is found in their memoirs and note-books, preserved
to this day. It appears that the treatment which they
received varied greatly, according to circumstances. Czar
Peter wished to keep the Swedish captives in the country
as long as possible, with the object of favorably influencing
his barbarous subjects by their superior abilities and culture.
He had commanded clemency in their treatment; but his
orders must have been disobeyed, for many Swedish soldiers
are known to have perished in the sulphur mines.
In Tobolsk and other towns of Siberia, Swedish majors and
captains were in great numbers occupied in the humble
pursuits of teachers, barbers, tailors, painters and blacksmiths.
Some kept shops and others made articles of the
Swedish sloyd, in which there was no competition in the
market. The pastimes were music and theatricals. There
were, among these thousands of prisoners, 9 generals, 17
colonels, 27 lieutenant-colonels, 38 majors, 494 captains,
975 lieutenants, 67 ministers of the Gospel, etc. A good
many of these were Swedish subjects of German descent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
or foreigners in Swedish service. The prisoners tried their
best to make it as pleasant for themselves as possible. They
formed a little community of their own in Moscow, with
Piper and Rehnskiold as their highest officials. Georg
Nordberg, pastor of the body-guards, was made the president
of a chapter-house, which held church conferences, issued
texts for special services, examined and consecrated ministers.
Czar Peter tried to attract some of the ablest officers
to him by promises of liberty and remunerative positions.
Many of the captives, seeing no prospect of freedom, decided
to remain in the country, entered the Greek church
and married Russian women. Some who could not endure
captivity made a revolt at Kasan, killing the armed troops,
and making an attempt to reach their own beloved country.
The plot was frustrated and was of sinister consequences,
for the Swedish captives commenced from that time, 1711,
to be transported to Siberia in great numbers. This was
only to move the important work of civilization eastward.
The captives, instead of succumbing to the severe climate,
unfolded the great energy of their race, cheerfully accommodating
their lives to the new requirements and devoting
their time to travels for scientific research, or mercantile
purposes, in Russian service, or on their own responsibility.
They made accounts and maps of undiscovered and unexplored
parts of Siberia, gathering results which have
been of great importance to later explorers, geologists and
ethnographers. Principal among these scientists are Philip
John von Strahlenberg, whose great book on Siberia was
published in Leipsic in 1730, and John Anton Matérn and
Peter Schœnstrœm, his collaborators; John Gustavus
Renat, made a prisoner by the Kalmucks, whom he
taught the secrets of manufacturing cannon and bombs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
and of printing books with movable types; Lorenz Lange,
who was secretary of several Russian embassies to the
imperial court of China, about which country he has given
valuable information; John B. Muller, John Schnitscher
and Ambjœrn Molin. Tobolsk was the centre of the Swedish
colonies in Siberia, where a peculiar sect grew up among
those of deep religious sentiment. A sectarian school, with
more than 100 pupils, was established, and the German
pietist, Aug. Herrman Francke, for some time supported
the movement. Governor Gagarin, who wanted to make
himself ruling sovereign of Siberia, arranged a formidable
conspiracy. It was discovered, the governor was hanged,
and the Swedish captives who were involved in it were sent
still further away to Nerschinsk.</p>

<p>If Charles XII., up to the date of the terrible battle of
Pultowa, has deserved our sympathy, in spite of his faults
and mistakes, it is impossible to look upon him in the same
charitable light for the rest of his career. The great defeat
and the loss of his army he described in letters to his sister,
Ulrica Eleonore, and the state council, as small misfortunes,
without consequence, which he was soon to repair.
Instead of trying his utmost to obtain peace on the best
possible conditions for his poor country, and instead of
saving his unhappy army from the miseries of captivity,
he made plans for new campaigns and demands for a new
army. Czar Peter expressed more correct views of the
situation. A few hours after the battle of Pultowa he
wrote to Admiral Apraxin: “Now rests at last secure our
city on the Neva.” And he was right. The period of
the political grandeur of Sweden was at an end.</p>

<p>Great was the renowned heroism of Charles XII. and
his warriors. Still greater, although less renowned, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
heroism with which his poor and neglected country suffered
the disasters which these glorious deeds brought upon it.
The regular troops of the army created by Charles XI.
had not been sufficient. New regiments were, one after
the other, created by means of increased taxes and repeated
enlistments, until it appeared as if the whole male population
was to be sent out in the endless wars, to be killed or
imprisoned, and the distressed country doomed to inevitable
destruction. Plague, hunger and emigration threatened
to make away with those spared from military service.
Swedes of the nineteenth century have difficulty in apprehending
how the country was able to endure such terrible
hardships.</p>

<p>The consequences of the defeat at Pultowa soon became
manifest. The enemies of Sweden had formed a better
idea of the resources of the country than had its own ruler,
and were resolved to profit by it. King August at once
declared the treaty of Alt-Ranstædt to be null and void, and
entered Poland, where he in a short time recovered his
lost authority. Stanislav fled and sought a refuge on
Swedish territory. King Charles later gave him his little
hereditary land of Palatinate-Zweibrucken. King Frederic
of Denmark declared war upon untenable grounds and had
an army of 16,000 men invade Scania. Helsingborg was
captured without difficulty. Great consternation was
caused by this assault upon the unhappy and apparently
defenceless country. The state council was brought to
despair. The situation was saved by Count Magnus Stenbock,
the able general. After having served as quartermaster-general
of the Swedish army in Poland, he was sent
back to Sweden, being governor-general of Scania at the
time when this province was invaded. He had not with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
him the necessary troops to meet the enemy, but left for
Smaland, where he gathered an army of peasants, chiefly
consisting of inexperienced but sturdy youths in wooden
shoes and coats of goatskins. From Vexio, where he had
met his new mustered troops, Stenbock returned to Scania,
in February, 1710, obtaining the reinforcements of a few
additional regiments, which swelled his army to the number
of 14,000 men. The well-equipped Danish force, which,
after an expedition into Bleking, returned to Scania, made
a good deal of fun of the “Stenbuk og hands Gededrenge”
(the mountain buck and his goatherds). Governor Stenbock
understood how to gain the confidence and rouse the
patriotism of his “goatherds.” He was soon sufficiently
sure of their ability to risk a battle, which was fought at
Helsingborg, February 28, 1710. The Danes, commanded
by George Rantzau, were routed, and sought a refuge
behind the walls of the town. The Danish losses were
4,000 killed and wounded and 3,000 prisoners, with their
camp, artillery and baggage. A few days later the Danes
evacuated Scania, returning to Seeland. The victory of
Helsingborg was the most glorious of the battles fought
by Magnus Stenbock. It saved Sweden in the hour of
direst distress, rekindling the hope which the battle of Pultowa
had extinguished. It was the last time in Swedish
history that the Danes entered Scania as enemies.</p>

<p>The victory at Helsingborg was only one bright star
in a night of darkness. In the Baltic provinces the disasters
followed close upon each other. Count Nils Stromberg,
the governor-general of Livonia, was forced to surrender
the town of Riga, July 1, 1710, after having fought
the Russians for months with great bravery. The enemies
which forced the able Stromberg to give up his cause were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
hunger and plagues. Not less than 40,000 Russians had
lost their lives outside the walls of Riga. Within a few
months Duenamuende, Pernau and Reval also surrendered.
This made complete the Russian conquest of the Swedish
empire in the Baltic provinces. The operations against
Finland, begun earlier, were continued with success. The
town and fortress of Viborg, which never had been occupied
by foreign troops, were captured in June, and Kexholm in
September. The country was unmercifully devastated,
in spite of solemn promises to the contrary.</p>

<p>That under such circumstances discontent against the
absolute ruler was fostered seems only natural. During
the first few years of the Carolinian campaign the noise
of the great victories was stronger than the voices of discontent
and complaint. When the glorious battles were
not followed by treaties of peace, the grumbling voices
grew louder. The king was at first not the object of the
growing discontent, but the state council, which was considered
to make greater demands than were necessary.
The king was supposed to fight for a righteous cause
against treacherous enemies, but the truth dawned on a
good many that a government invested with absolute power
was the cause of the misery. The battle of Pultowa
brought to a mature state the thoughts of a change in the
constitution, thoughts which for years had occupied the
ablest men of the country. The double government was
to a great extent responsible for the bad state of affairs.
The king tried to rule with absolute power from his headquarters
in Saxony, Poland and the Ukraine, with Piper
as his adviser. At home the state council held the reins of
government and sometimes acted in direct opposition to the
instructions or intentions of the king. Charles XII. was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
very jealous of his power, and the state council, foremost
in which were a few men of the very highest ability, like
Count Arvid Horn, was on this account sometimes unable
to carry out its best endeavors. Charles by his methods
brought confusion and uncertainty into the deliberations
and acts of the government, injuring the commonwealth
and the principles of an absolute monarchy as well. The
king was not able to supervise the details of his administration,
and unrighteous officers profited thereby, by their
unlawful collections of taxes, causing open revolts of the
suffering population in various parts of the country.</p>

<p>The state council took no pains to hide the truth from
the king, rather using strong colors in their descriptions
of the critical condition in order to obtain the much-sought-for
and needed peace, or at least the gratification of seeing
the armies of the country used exclusively for the defence
of its own possessions. King Charles considered the members
of the state council as a body of weaklings, cowards
and fools, who painted the devil on the wall because they
lacked the courage and endurance to await the final and infallible
triumph of his royal arms in a righteous cause.
The climax was reached after the arrival of Charles at
Bender. The state council commenced to negotiate for
peace on its own responsibility. It also convoked a committee
of the Estates of the Riksdag to a meeting for deliberations
on measures which would better the hopeless conditions
of the state and people. King Charles learned of it
and sent from Bender a remarkable order, in which he absolutely
forbade such meetings, “especially because the last
convention of the Estates,” he wrote, “had no other consequence
than to let them still plainer discover their impoverished
condition.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p>King Charles lingered in Bender, fascinated by the plans
made by several Turkish princes of an armed support
against his enemies, or at least an escort of troops for his
return through Poland. The king succeeded in his efforts
to force the sultan of Turkey to an attack on Russia. The
Turks, 200,000 strong, made an invasion, according to plans
drawn up by Charles, and were successful in completely
surrounding a Russian army, commanded by Czar Peter in
person, at the shores of the river Pruth. The czar saved
himself by a supreme effort, sacrificing all his gold and the
jewels of the czarina as bribes to the grand vizier, who commanded
the Turkish army. This dignitary let the Russians
escape, thus spoiling the plans of the whole campaign. To
Charles it was a great disappointment. His hope to see the
Russian giant crushed, and the defeat at Pultowa avenged,
was gone forever. His plan of reaching Poland with
Turkish troops to join Stenbock and a Swedish army was
shaken with the loss of confidence in his barbarous allies.
The perfidious grand vizier was punished, but the agreement
of peace which he had made with the czar was sanctioned
by the sultan, in 1711.</p>

<p>The Swedish state council was quite reluctant to obey
the repeated orders of the king for a new army, hesitating
to impose new burdens upon the suffering people. The king
grew impatient and there was no escape possible. Magnus
Stenbock, the most popular man in all Sweden, set an
example of personal sacrifices which was followed by many
others, and a new army of 9,000 men was at last equipped
with a navy to carry it across the Baltic to Pomerania.
Stenbock landed in the island of Rugen, in September,
1712, and increased his army to 14,000. He abandoned
the idea to march toward Poland because the king remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
at Bender, and entered Mecklenburg after having skilfully
avoided meeting a superior force of Russian and Saxon
troops, which followed him at a distance. Negotiations
of peace had been commenced before the arrival of Stenbock,
between the dethroned Stanislav of Poland, who was then
in Pomerania, and King August. This caused a standstill
in the operations, an armistice of a fortnight having been
agreed to, with a prospect of renewal. The Danes made
an end to it, entering Mecklenburg in December. When the
armistice was at an end, Stenbock hastened with his troops
to Gadebusch, where the Danish army was encamped, by
this rapid move preventing the latter from joining the Russian
and Saxon forces. Only a detachment of Saxon cavalry
had succeeded in reaching the Danish camp. The
battle of Gadebusch was fought December 9, 1712, and
was the last of the great victories on land that a Swedish
army ever won on the Continent. The Danes were crushingly
defeated, and their allies found it safest to return to
their former fortified positions. The Swedish artillery,
commanded by Charles Cronstedt, distinguished itself in
this battle against an enemy of superior strength. But
Stenbock could not for any length of time keep up the
struggle against the armies of three countries, not receiving
any support from Sweden, nor sufficient provisions in Mecklenburg.
When the Danes burned the town of Stade, Stenbock
in revenge burned Altona, toward the end of the year.
His army was reduced for lack of provisions, and Stenbock
saw no other course to take than to shut himself up with
his troops in the fortress of Tœnning, in the possession of
the young duke of Holstein-Gottorp. Stenbock persevered
in his hopes for support from Sweden, or friendly powers,
in vain. Efforts were made in Sweden to send him troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
and provisions, but did not prove successful. When death
from starvation was impending, the valiant general concluded
to surrender. May 6, 1713, it was agreed that Stenbock
and his army of 11,000 men should become Danish
prisoners, but that they should be exchanged at the earliest
opportunity. King Frederic IV. of Denmark dishonestly
neglected to fulfil this agreement, repeatedly and flatly
refusing to exchange any of the prisoners. The hero of
the victories at Helsingborg and Gadebusch at first received
a tolerably good treatment in Danish captivity, which later
was changed in a horrible manner. After years of cruel
suffering, he died in a miserable dungeon, in 1717, one year
prior to the death of Charles XII. This great descendant
of Eric Stenbock and Magdalen Sture tried to kill the time
of his captivity by carving in ivory, some articles of exquisite
design by his hand still being preserved.</p>

<p>At the surrender of Tœnning, Sweden lost her last
army and her ablest general. Her king dwelt among the
Turks in circumstances fraught with increasing dangers,
and her enemies on every side stood ready for attack, the
country being a prey to discontent and despair. Still her
measure of misery and contumely was not filled.</p>

<p>Charles XII. persevered in his strange sojourn at Bender,
being a guest who caused the sultan continual worry
through his great political influence. The king was resolved
to leave Turkey only in one manner, and that was
escorted by a Turkish force. He was successful in persuading
the sultan to declare war on Russia once more, but Czar
Peter hastened to make so many concessions that peace was
made before any campaign was begun. King Frederic of
Prussia offered Charles an alliance on the condition that
he should at once return to Sweden. Charles seemed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
last inclined to do so, but then a conspiracy was brought
to his notice, disclosing a plan by which the perfidious
Turkish princes of his intended escort were to deliver him
into the hands of King August of Poland. King Charles
refused to leave Poland, and the conspirators effected an
order from the sultan to attack Charles with an army of
10,000 men, and bring him, dead or alive, to Adrianople.
The order was executed February 11, 1713, Charles defending
himself with his few hundred Swedes and some
Poles of his escort against the overwhelming force of Turks
and Tartars. The house of the king, near Bender, had
been strongly fortified for the occasion. When the trenches
were taken most of his men surrendered, but Charles remained
with fifty Swedes in the house, which was built
of wood, warding off the attack and putting the enemy
to flight with a heroism vividly recalling the tales of the
ancient Sagas. The Turks returned toward evening and
ignited the building. The Swedes valiantly continued their
struggle, fighting with their swords against the Turks, surrounded
by heavy fire and by the smoke of the burning
building. The king at last was forced to leave the house
and tried to make his way to the neighboring chancery
building, which was of stone and better fit to withstand
an attack. Charles stumbled and fell, and was at once
made prisoner, together with his followers. This peculiar
incident, which has been called the Kalabalik, or Popular
Tumult, of Bender, aroused universal surprise and dislike.
Charles was conducted to a Turkish pasha, who treated him
with respect. He was under supervision first at the town
of Demotika, later at the palace of Timurtasz, both in the
vicinity of Adrianople. Charles considered it incompatible
with his royal dignity to call on the grand vizier. For this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
reason it was given out that he was ill, and in his miraculous
stubbornness he persevered in keeping his bed for a
whole year! During all this time, Charles followed up his
policy of governing Sweden from afar with absolute despotism.
He prepared new rules for the chancery, attempting
to change the form of administration from one of faculties,
or colleges, to one of departments, or bureaus. He made
negotiations of peace in the same spirit as of yore, viz.,
without being willing to make any concessions, and planned
new campaigns. For recreation he played chess and listened
to music.</p>

<p>In Sweden the peculiar Turkish adventures of Charles
XII. were not understood or appreciated, and the country
seemed forsaken by all, even by the king, who by many
was thought to be insane. The state council saw no possibility
of maintaining a government without the consent
and goodwill of the people. Plans for a new constitution,
a reduction of the royal power and a peace at any cost
were in the air. Princess Ulrica Eleonore was called as
a member of the state council and a Riksdag was convoked,
to meet toward the end of 1713. The Estates declared that
they were, in case of necessity, ready to seek peace under
the auspices of the princess and the state council, and were
in favor of appointing the princess to the regency. Arvid
Horn, the leading spirit of the state council, used the utmost
of his influence in keeping the Riksdag from the revolutionary
acts which would be involved in making Ulrica
Eleonore regent, but he saw to it that the declaration of the
Riksdag, of intended peace-making through the princess
and state council, was communicated to the king. Hans
Henric von Liewen, one of the state councillors, was
selected to carry this communication to the king, together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
with letters from the queen-dowager and the state
council. Count Liewen gave a full and true account
to the king, telling him in plain words that if he did
not return home without delay his kingdom would be
lost to him.</p>

<p>King Charles at last decided to return to his country.
He sent an embassy of seventy-two people to officially
announce his departure to the sultan at Constantinople,
made a loan of a considerable sum of money, and left
Demotika with a large escort. In Wallachia he left the
Turks behind, and continued on his way through Hungary
and Germany, followed by two Swedish officers. The
emperor of Germany, who was desirous of winning over
the Swedish king for his plans, prepared a hospitable reception,
but Charles passed Vienna <i>incognito</i> as Captain Peter
Frisk. He rode on, through night and day, taking care
of his own horse and never changing his clothes. Charles
arrived at the gate of Stralsund, in Swedish Pomerania,
in the night of November 11, 1714, accompanied by one
officer. In a fortnight he had, on horseback, traversed a
stretch of 1,300 miles.</p>

<p>The situation at the arrival of Charles XII. in Stralsund
was beset with new dangers and complications. Prussia
had ceased to be friendly and was planning to seize the
Swedish possessions in Germany. Hanover, united with
England under the same ruler, had the same ambition.
The dilapidated fortifications of Stralsund were attacked
by Saxons and Danes, commanded by their respective
kings, August and Frederic. For more than a year,
Charles, with admirable heroism, withstood the siege.
Once, while the king was dictating a letter to a secretary,
the latter sprang to his feet in consternation, a bomb hav<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>ing
shattered the roof of the building. “The bomb, your
majesty, the bomb!” exclaimed the scribe. Charles answered:
“What connection is there between the bomb and
my letter?” quietly continuing his dictation. The king
found it at last impossible to keep up the defence of Stralsund,
leaving it a stormy December night, and arriving
safely in the town of Trelleborg, on the southernmost point
of Sweden, December 15, 1715.</p>

<p>What a different country that Sweden was which
Charles XII. left in August, 1699, at the very summit
of her political grandeur, to the impoverished and suffering
Sweden in which he had now landed! And what a different
man he had himself become during these sixteen years
of absence! Sweden had won a new hero king, of greater
fame than any of his predecessors or successors, but lost
her prosperity for the time being and her political grandeur
forever. The people received the king with demonstrations
of joy and with reviving hope for an honorable peace. The
state council and the intelligent few received him with
badly concealed hopelessness and indifference. They knew
that although the young ambitious king had changed to
a world-famous hero, prematurely aged in victory and
defeat, the unyielding stubbornness and the never satiated
desire for glory had remained unchanged in Charles XII.
Charles was met by a message from the dying queen-dowager,
his grandmother, with an ardent prayer for peace.
Charles answered to hopes and prayers, to silent indifference
and despair, with a command of more money and more
troops! He wanted peace, but as he spoke in the same
terms as when he was the victorious commander of an
apparently invincible army, nobody cared to consider his
demands in earnest. The absolute power reached its last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
stage of development, a military despotism which had no
other policy than war, no other administration than the
one requisite to maintain and provide the requirements of
war. The state council fell in deepest disgrace, and its
functions ceased, in 1715.</p>

<p>During the last years of his reign, Charles XII. took no
advice of Swedish men. Foreign adventurers and schemers
were in charge of the affairs of state, principal among
whom was Baron George Henric Gœrtz. This man was
a minister of state of the young duke of Holstein-Gottorp,
in whose service he remained, and in whose interests, as a
successor to Charles XII. on the throne of Sweden, he zealously
worked, while developing into the all-powerful minister
of the Swedish king. Charles granted him authority
to act in his name in almost every branch of the government,
interior as well as foreign. Gœrtz was a genius, but
utterly reckless. For his acts the king was responsible, not
he. Gœrtz was a foreigner and working for the cause of
a foreign master. He tried to obtain loans abroad, made
compulsory loans within the country, placed a tax on
articles of luxury, and put in circulation coins of copper
which were a kind of “promissory notes,” worthless in themselves,
but each representing a Swedish dollar. At first
these “coins of need” were issued to the amount of a sensible
sum, but were soon increased in number at the command
of Charles XII. himself, so that they represented higher
sums than the crown could redeem, and thus lost their
value. The people refused to take them, while the prices
of everything in the market rose to an astounding height.
The government, in order to save itself from this difficulty,
took possession of all coined money and uncoined silver, and
gave the “coins of need” in exchange, perpetrating several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
other scandalous acts of violence against the rights of private
property.</p>

<p>The situation grew almost insupportable. Commerce
and industry, injured by the war, ceased entirely because
nobody was inclined to sell, only to receive in exchange
worthless coins. Wars and hard years combined in creating
misery and distress everywhere. The peasants were recklessly
treated, and a disregard for moral obligations grew
out of the bad examples set by the government. The
students and scientists had in great numbers been carried
away by the bloody wars, and the interest in the fields
of culture was slackened by the power of financial depression.
The wealthy and well-to-do saw their means daily
diminish, and, losing their interest in public welfare, they
tried to save the remnants of their own property. The
members of the state council were threatened by investigations
which Gœrtz and his friends were scheming to institute
against them. In the nobility, the plans for a change
of the constitution matured, the leaders in this movement
being Count Per Ribbing and the old Gyllencreutz, who
had prophesied the outcome of an absolute monarchial
government.</p>

<p>Charles XII., in spite of his all-absorbing passion for
war, did not lack interest for the pursuits of peace. He
encouraged several men of genius, of whom two were
eminently worthy of distinction; viz., Nicodemus Tessin,
Junior, the architect, and Christopher Polhem, the engineer.</p>

<p>Nicodemus Tessin was born in Nykœping in 1654. His
father and namesake belonged to an old Pomeranian family,
and had come to Sweden during the reign of Queen Christine.
Nicodemus Tessin, Senior, was an able architect, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
built the castle of Drottningholm for Queen-dowager Hedvig
Eleonore, a moderately gifted but art-loving woman.
The latter gathered around herself artists and architects
at her castle of Drottningholm, in Lake Mælar, among
whom were Ehrenstrahl, a famous artist of German birth,
who founded the first school of Swedish painters. The
younger Tessin belonged to this circle and was, in their
respective times, in the favor of Charles XI. and Charles
XII., acting as court architect to both. The work which
won for him an immortal fame is the royal palace of Stockholm,
an architectural creation worthy of the admiration
of all Europe, and, in Sweden, standing unsurpassed to this
day. It was planned and commenced by Tessin, but completed
according to his plans a hundred years after his
death. Charles XI. ordered a reconstruction of the old
castle, which enterprise Tessin undertook. Shortly after
the death of Charles XI., both the old and the reconstructed
parts of the palace were burned, and the body
of the king with difficulty saved from the conflagration.
Charles XII. ordered Tessin to build an entirely new
palace. The work was commenced in 1698, but was gradually
abandoned during the war times, to cease shortly
before the battle of Pultowa. Charles was highly interested
in it and wrote from Turkey to Tessin about his
views. Tessin intended to decorate the exterior according
to the taste of his day, but Charles raised opposition, finding
the severe beauty of the stern yet graceful outlines perfect
in themselves. The work on the new palace was
recommenced after the death of Charles XII. King Adolphus
Frederic was the first who took up his residence within
its walls. Tessin rose high on the social ladder. From
Turkey, the king made him a count and chancellor of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
University of Lund; after his return to Sweden he appointed
him marshal-colonel. Tessin stood in strong
opposition to Baron Gœrtz, and after the death of King
Charles joined the leaders of the revolutionary nobles. He
was of universal fame.</p>

<p>Christopher Polhem was the first of great Swedish engineers
and inventors. He was born at the ancient town
of Visby, in the island of Gothland, in 1661, and was the
son of a merchant, who died when Christopher was a child.
When only twelve years of age he had to make his own
living. As secretary to a widow of wealth, he early developed
his genius as a mechanician, building his own shop
of carpentry, sloyd, etc., making watches and devising
smaller inventions. His want of a classical education was
detrimental to him, and he commenced, when twenty-four
years of age, to study Latin with various ministers in the
country, in exchange for works of his genius and handicraft.
At last he was able to enter the University of Upsala
by means of recommendations from his last teacher.
Soon after his arrival he created considerable attention and
admiration by a proof of his ingenuity. Behind the high
altar in the Upsala Cathedral there was a clock of the finest
workmanship, devised in mediæval times by a monk of the
monastery of Vadstena. It was out of order, and not for
a hundred years had anybody attempted to set it right.
Polhem undertook to reconstruct the whole work, connecting
with the main mechanism all the hands which pointed
out the hours of the day, the eclipses of the moon and the
motions of the “ruling” planets, according to the system
of the astrologers. Polhem succeeded in his task, and was
allowed to test his invention of automatic haulers of ore in
the mines. The college of mining, before which the inven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>tion
was successfully demonstrated, accepted it, and Charles
XI. appointed Polhem a mining engineer. In 1694, Polhem
made an extensive journey through England and the Continent.
In Paris he learned that several mathematicians
were in vain endeavoring to construct a clock which would
simultaneously show the time of the day in various countries
and strike the hours at the same time. Polhem announced
through the Swedish ambassador in Paris that he
was willing to solve the problem. He constructed a model
which gave universal satisfaction. Louis XIV. had a clock
made after this model and gave it as a gift of honor to the
Turkish sultan. Upon his return he proposed the founding
of a <i>laboratorium mechanicum</i>, which in several respects
served as a pattern for the later technological institutes
of Stockholm and Gothenburg. The youthful Charles
XII. embraced the idea with interest, but the promising
institution came to a standstill during the wars. Among
Polhem’s more remarkable inventions was one for the leading
of water-power, to be used at considerable distances.
Charles XII. said that a man like Polhem was not to be had
for several centuries, and that for this reason he ought to be
made useful as long as he lived. A task of gigantic proportions
was intrusted to him&mdash;the construction of a dock
for the navy yards at Carlskrona. The great engineer filled
it in an admirable way, and was appointed councillor of
commerce and ennobled under the name of Polhem, his
original name having been Polhammar, which to modern
ears sounds just as fine and a good deal more suggestive.</p>

<p>Another gigantic task worthy of the genius of Polhem
was the construction of a navigable route from the North
Sea across the great inland seas of Sweden to the Baltic, but
he was not allowed to finish it. Charles XII. intrusted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
work to Polhem, who was to have it ready in five years.
In 1718, Polhem commenced by forming an immense sluice,
by means of explosions in the rock at Trollhetta. The great
waterfalls of said place were to be avoided and the work
of completing the sluice was begun, when it was all destroyed
by unknown enemies, who dropped beams and
planks in the river above, which carried away the dam.
The death of King Charles and the impoverished condition
of the country made it impossible to continue the work on
the great canal system, which had to wait for more than
a century for its ultimate completion. With the death of
Charles XII. the era of ambitious enterprises came to an
end; but Polhem was employed in various works of mechanic
improvements in the interest of agriculture, industry
and manufactures. Czar Peter of Russia, King George
I. of England, and several other monarchs made brilliant
offers in order to win Polhem for their countries. He executed
several works and inventions abroad, but loved his
own country too much to leave it. Polhem exerted a great
influence in the interest of his science, both by instruction
and by the publication of technical works. Active to the
last, he died in 1751. Polhem was a man of a harmonious
endowment, amiable and dignified, and preserved his plain
mode of living throughout his brilliant career.</p>

<p>Gœrtz led with superior skill the negotiations for peace,
while the impoverished country suffered untold miseries as
a consequence of his unscrupulous financial schemes. He
tried to benefit by the sudden but lasting enmity between
Czar Peter and George I., desiring to gain the support of
either against the other. The deliberations were held in the
archipelago of Aland, with Gœrtz as the representative
of the Swedish government. Czar Peter wanted to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
Ingermanland, Esthonia and Livonia, but was ready to
cede Finland, which country he occupied, and to assist
King Charles with troops in an attack on Denmark. Norway
was to be the compensation for the lost Baltic provinces,
and the attack on Denmark was to be made from Germany.
Charles XII. had no confidence in the czar as an ally and
had commenced the conquest of Norway directly and without
his aid. No decision was reached in the negotiations
with England.</p>

<p>In February, 1716, Charles XII., from Bohuslæn and
Vermland, made an invasion into Norway, penetrating over
the Glom River to Christiania. He captured the capital,
where he held his headquarters for several weeks, but was
not able to take the fortress of Akershus, which, with its
artillery, commanded the city. The Swedish army, 10,000
strong, suffered a great deal from want of provisions and
through a guerilla war, skilfully conducted by the Norwegians.
Charles was in danger of being surrounded by the
enemy, and with difficulty retreated to Sweden, over the
Strait of Svinesund. The dangers were increased by the
Norwegian naval hero, Peter Tordenskiold, who, with some
Danish ships under his command, had destroyed a flotilla
of Swedish transport vessels. An invasion into Scania by
Denmark and her allies was planned for the summer, but
did not materialize. King Charles took up his headquarters
at Lund.</p>

<p>The war offered no aspect of interest during the year
1717, except some unsuccessful attempts made by Tordenskiold
to capture the towns of Strœmstad and Gothenburg.
Charles prepared another attack on Norway, and,
by draining the last resources of his country, managed
to equip an army of 60,000 men. In August, 1718, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
smaller army, under the command of Charles Gustavus
Armfelt, was sent through Jemtland over the mountains
into the diocese of Drontheim. King Charles, with an
army of 30,000 men, invaded Norway from Bohuslæn, Dal
and Vermland, and took in possession the country east of
the Glom River. Within a few days the king laid siege
to the fortress of Fredericsten, close by the town of Fredricshall.
November 27th the fort of Gyldenlœve was captured,
and the Swedes moved their trenches ever closer
to the fortress, which seemed doomed to surrender. In the
evening of November 30th the king was seen in one of
the trenches watching the work of his soldiers, and leaning
against the rampart. He remained there a long time, not
heeding the appeals of his officers, who grew uneasy on
account of the apparent danger to his person. Suddenly
his head sank down on his breast. A bullet from the fortress
had reached him, penetrating his temples and causing
instant death. He met death in the manner he most desired
it, although not while engaged in battle.</p>

<p>Charles XII. was of an enigmatic character, which attracts,
through its strength and superiority over his contemporaries,
but which is repulsive through its tenacity,
unyielding sternness and inaccessibility to reason or persuasion.
His moral greatness has won admiration. It had
its limitations, but was superior to the standards of his time.
His ideals were pure and lofty, but, through lack of contact
with the realities and facts of life, only assumed a tragic
grandeur, without proving beneficent to mankind. His
faults were such that his education and experience as an
absolute monarch aggravated them. Charles XII. was the
most remarkable man of his age and one of the greatest
soldiers that ever lived. He was also a great general,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
although the proper balance between the soldier and the
field marshal, perhaps, was to some extent lacking. The
influence of his personality and example had a miraculous
effect upon his soldiers. He suffered his one great defeat
in open battle when wounded, suffering, and not able to
exert his usual influence to its full extent.</p>

<p>Charles XII. has been idolized by his countrymen of all
ages, who in him have recognized an impersonation of
all their chief national virtues, with a few of their national
faults, enlarged into the image of a patriotic hero of almost
supernatural grandeur. The Swedish people were forced
to accept absolute power as a salvation from the impending
thraldom of oligarchy. In Charles XII. it saw to what
a climax of abuse this power could attain, even in hands
which were deemed righteous and free from stains. With
Charles XII. the political grandeur and the absolute monarchy
of Sweden came to an end, although attempts to
restore both were to be made. A new phase of her development,
with new improvements and new evils, commenced
with the reign of Ulrica Eleonore.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Period of Liberty&mdash;The Aristocratic Republic</i></span></h2>

<p>Ulrica Eleonore succeeded her brother Charles
XII as the sovereign of Sweden. She was proclaimed
queen by birthright, and called the Riksdag,
willing to cede the absolute power. When the Riksdag
convened a disagreeable surprise met her. The Estates
refused to acknowledge her right to the crown, stating that
both she and her older sister had deprived themselves of
their rights of succession by marrying without the consent
of the Estates of the Riksdag. Princess Hedvig Sophie was
dead, but her son, the young Duke Charles Frederic of
Holstein was in Sweden, ready to claim the throne. Ulrica
Eleonore was compelled to yield gracefully. She sent a
note to the Riksdag disclaiming her hereditary right, but
declaring herself willing to accept the crown, with restriction
of the absolute power. She was at once elected queen
by the Riksdag of 1719, which then proceeded to pass a new
constitution. Such a constitution had been formulated in
advance by a new party, chiefly consisting of nobles, who
aimed at introducing a royal government, restricted in its
power by the state council and the Riksdag. They were
successful in their efforts, but unfortunately lost their ablest
leaders at the start, Per Ribbing dying soon after the first
Riksdag, and Arvid Horn retiring from the government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
and council on account of a conflict with the queen. Thus
the new government did not open up under favorable auspices.
Baron von Gœrtz was captured and put to death
for high treason without being granted the privilege of an
appropriate legal defence. The queen overstepped her limit
of power in being the active force in this illegal execution,
anxious to rid herself of Gœrtz because he was the ablest
man among the supporters of Duke Charles Frederic of
Holstein. The duke gave up his chances and left for
Russia, where he married a daughter of Czar Peter. The
arrangements made to establish order in financial matters
were not satisfactory. The management of the war with
Denmark was miserable. The army was recalled from
Norway and little done to protect the coast from attacks
by the Danish fleet under Admiral Tordenskiold. This
valiant naval hero, of Norwegian birth, who, during the
reign of Charles XII., had made unsuccessful attacks on
Strœmstad and Gothenburg, through cunning captured the
strong fortress of Carlsten, but was unable to take New
Elfsborg. Danckwardt, the commander who surrendered
Carlsten, was executed by the Swedish government. The
Swedish army of 6,000 men, which had entered the district
of Dronthiem by the command of Charles XII., perished
from hunger and cold when returning through the mountains
of Jemtland. Only a few hundred survived to tell
the terrible tale. The Russians sent a fleet to the Swedish
shores with 40,000 men, and burned, in two expeditions,
twelve Swedish towns in the middle and northern parts
of the country. They avoided open battle, and when landing
in great numbers were effectively repulsed.</p>

<p>Under such conditions Sweden was anxious for peace.
In compensation for various sums of money, Bremen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
Verden were ceded to Hanover in 1719, Pomerania, south
of the river Peene, with Stettin, Usedom and Wollin to
Prussia, in 1720, and Ingermanland, Esthonia, Livonia,
with Viborg and Kexholm, and surrounding Finnish territory,
to Russia, in 1721. Denmark had to give up all
territory captured from Sweden, but received a sum of
money in exchange for Carlsten, in 1720. Thus the Baltic
empire of Sweden was swept away. It had been of importance
during the time of the German war and for the
shielding of new conquests in the Scandinavian Peninsula
itself. Now its loss was a gain for Sweden, as it allowed
her to concentrate her attention upon the interior development
of the country.</p>

<p>The tendency of Ulrica Eleonore to exert more power
than was within her authority had created dissatisfaction,
and when she commenced an agitation to have her consort,
Prince Frederic of Hesse, share the throne with her, the
crown was granted him only upon her own resignation from
the government.</p>

<p>Frederic I. was crowned in 1720 and Ulrica Eleonore
retired from the government. Frederic left the Reformed
and entered the Lutheran Church. The crown was to be
inherited by his male issues only, in the union with Ulrica
Eleonore. He showed a tendency for mixing in the affairs
of state to further his own interests, but soon gave in to
his easy-tempered, pleasure-loving nature, occupying himself
exclusively with his hunts and his mistresses.</p>

<p>The real ruler of Sweden, during the first two decades
of Frederic’s reign, was <i>Arvid Horn</i>, one of the greatest
of Swedish statesmen. His was not the work of building
up the government of a strong and influential nation, like
that of Oxenstierna or Gyllenstierna, nor were his their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
grand, far-reaching views. But his mission was to raise
from the dust his bleeding, downtrodden country, and to
reinstall it in the honor and respect, not only of itself but
of the world. Count Arvid Bernhard Horn was an opportunist,
but one of the noblest kind, who by means of peace
found the only way in which to protect and further the
financial and cultural development of Sweden. He was
an able soldier and a skilled diplomatist. The son of an
illustrious but poor family, of the Finnish nobility, he entered
the military service after a university course at Abo.
He served in foreign armies, but was with Charles XII.
in Stockholm as the best companion of his youth. As the
commander of the royal body-guard he took an honorable
part in the early victories of Charles XII., later being
chosen to fulfil the delicate task of making the Polish
nobles elect Stanislav king, in which he was eminently successful.
After a short captivity he was released and returned
to Sweden, where he became a member of the state
council and president of the state chancery. In this position
he repeatedly sent letters to Charles XII., in which
he described the distress of the country, in eloquent words
pleading its need of peace. Upon his return Charles XII.
removed him from office with the other councillors, although
he was the one who had saved the tottering throne for the
king. Of this Ulrica Eleonore was aware and was glad to
accept his resignation; when reinstated in his position he
found that he could not preserve it with dignity in the face
of the irregularities committed by the queen. Count Horn
was responsible for the exclusion of Ulrica Eleonore from the
government at King Frederic’s ascendency, but the latter
was forced to accept Horn in his former position as the controlling
power of the government. With due reason, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
peaceful and honorable decades of Frederic’s reign have
been named the “Period of Arvid Horn.”</p>

<p>The new form of government introduced by Ribbing,
Horn and others was nothing else than that of an aristocratic
republic. The rights of the monarch, reduced in
1719, were still further reduced in 1720. He had two votes
in the state council and a deciding vote in deadlock, but
besides the authority to appoint councillors from the candidates
nominated by the Riksdag, and to appoint all higher
officials, no other rights. The government was in the
hands of the state council, consisting of sixteen members.
The Riksdag decided all questions of taxes and legislation,
and settled issues of peace and war. Each of the four
Estates was represented in the committees, except in the
“secret committee,” for international affairs, to which no
yeoman could be chosen. Each Estate had its speaker.
The president of the chancery was the minister of foreign
affairs and consulted the secret committee on important
questions, being the only head of a department who was
allowed as a member of the state council. The nobility
held the balance of power, much to the opposition of the
lower Estates, who tried, by repeated agitation, to invest
the king with the authority held by him before the days
of absolute power. The nobility had done away with its
three classes, and, with these abandoned, it was the majority,
viz., the lower nobility, who were the governing class.
The aristocracy tried its best to regain the privileges enjoyed
during the reign of Queen Christine and Charles X.,
but Horn forced it to be satisfied with those granted by
Gustavus Adolphus. The power of the higher nobility was
forever crushed by the loss of their immense possessions.
The friction between the nobility and the lower Estates of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
the Riksdag was constant, Horn siding with the former, but
keeping them all in check.</p>

<p>Arvid Horn led with superior skill and gentleness the
management of foreign affairs. All influences from the
powers and from the restless nobles to involve Sweden in
a conflict of war were unsuccessful. A treaty was never entered
into with any one power without another one formed
with a power of the opposite continental party to counterbalance
it. Thus England, France and Russia were unable
to make Sweden an obedient ally, Horn upholding her
independence, maintaining peace and inspiring respect.
Utterly refusing to accept the bribes which were freely
offered and considered the indispensable means of obtaining
diplomatic influence in that day, Horn himself distributed
bribes to gain his patriotic purposes. Horn’s great mistake
was to refer the decision of foreign affairs in which he was
opposed by members of the state council to the Riksdag and
its secret committee. The latter commenced to act independently
in important foreign matters. By signing an
agreement with France, through which Sweden lost its
former privilege of an independent policy, the committee
ultimately caused his downfall, in 1738. Arvid Horn then
retired, at the age of seventy-two, and died a few years
later.</p>

<p>During Horn’s peaceful administration the financial conditions
improved, the state debt was reduced and the peaceful
trades and industries were furthered. The great deed
accomplished was the completion of a new state law which
was published in 1734 and is in force to this very day.
Arvid Horn was a perfect type of the great Carolin era, of
pure and severe morals and modest requirements. In a day
of increasing scepticism and levity, he ostentatiously pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>served
the rigid religious practices of his youth. He
showed unreserved indignation at the unworthy and immoral
conduct of the king, for which reason strained relations
existed between them. Count Horn was of impressive
form and carriage, controlling the quick temper of the warrior
beneath the smooth and dignified bearing of the statesman.</p>

<p>The decades which followed upon the fall of Arvid
Horn were stormy ones and full of miseries. The friends
of peace were called Caps and the warlike party Hats.
The latter, now in power, commenced a war against Russia,
which turned out badly, the Swedes being defeated at Vilmanstrand,
in 1741, and at Helsingfors, in 1742. The government
and secret committee felt ashamed of their work
and had the poor generals, Charles Emil Lewenhaupt and
Buddenbrock, executed for their lack of martial skill and
good fortune. Peace was made with Russia in 1743, the
towns of Fredericshamn, Vilmanstrand and Nyslott, in
Finland, being ceded by Sweden, and the river Kymene
made the boundary line.</p>

<p>Next the Hats had to face a rebellion. In order to
please Elizabeth of Russia, Czar Peter’s daughter, they
had selected Charles Peter Ulric, her nephew and the son
of the duke of Holstein, as heir-apparent to the Swedish
throne, to which he was the nearest in right, Ulrica Eleonore
dying without issue, in 1741. But when chosen as
Elizabeth’s successor in Russia, the Hats selected Adolphus
Frederic, prince bishop of Lubeck, who on his mother’s side
was a descendant of Gustavus Adolphus. This caused
popular discontent, the people, forgetful of past enmities,
desiring to make Crown Prince Frederic of Denmark heir-apparent.
The peasants at the Riksdag of 1742 proclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
loudly their desire of a personal union with Denmark-Norway,
which would establish Scandinavia as one solid power
against Russia. The peasants of Helsingland and Dalecarlia
revolted. They gathered, and marching down to
Stockholm, placed the government in a dangerous position
by demanding the election of Crown Prince Frederic
of Denmark and the execution of the two imprisoned
generals. In that very moment peace was obtained with
Russia, and the government persuaded the leaders of the
rebellion, who had obtained admission to the Riksdag, that
Adolphus Frederic must be chosen, since it was a part of
the treaty of peace. Later the rebels, 3,500 in number,
were forced to surrender. Their principal leader was
executed.</p>

<p>The Hats were at first led by Count Gyllenborg, who
was succeeded by the brilliant Count Charles Gustavus
Tessin, a son of the great architect, Nicodemus Tessin the
Younger. Although not a statesman of any higher ability,
Charles Gustavus Tessin was able to shake the oppressive
influence of Russia. He was assisted by Prince Adolphus
Frederic, who said he would rather resign than be a Russian
vassal. A war seemed imminent, but was averted,
Finland in the meantime being effectively fortified. The
unconquerable fortress of Sveaborg was built near Helsingfors,
and was the creation of Augustinus Ehrensverd. The
Hats were eager in their attempts to encourage industry
and manufacture, but did so at the expense of agriculture,
and placed immense taxes on imported goods. A pioneer
of industry was John Alstrœmer, who, in his town of
Alingsos, built factories of various kinds. King Frederic
died in 1751.</p>

<p><i>Adolphus Frederic</i> was a good-natured and gentle man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
He was not averse to an increased royal authority, but was
not energetic enough to exert a controlling influence or to
push his claims. His consort was the ambitious and brilliantly
gifted Louise Ulrica, the sister of Frederic the Great
of Prussia. She tried to inspire the king to action. Continually
occupied by ambitious schemes, she spoiled them
herself, through lack of caution and stability. As crown
princess, she stood close to Count Tessin, whom she hoped
to win over for her plans. They devised the institution of
the knightly orders of the Seraphim, the Sword and the
North Star, the credit of their introduction being given to
King Frederic I. Adolphus Frederic was forced to subscribe
to the same minimum of royal privileges as those
enjoyed by Frederic I. At court a party was formed
which supported the king, who soon commenced to oppose
the state council. In 1755 this went so far that he refused
to sign a document from the council. The case was
brought before the Riksdag, where, in spite of strong opposition
from the peasants, a resolution was passed indorsing
the action of the state council. Count Tessin, in friction
with the court, resigned from all his positions. The Riksdag
tried to reinstall him as governor of the royal princes,
but gave in upon the request of Tessin. The Riksdag went
to the extreme of having a stamp made of the king’s signature,
to use in cases where he refused to sign, and also took
upon itself to engage and dismiss teachers for the royal
princes. At court indignation rose high, and a conspiracy
was formed to take possession of the capital, with the state
council and the speakers of the four Estates, in order to
bring about a revolution with increased power for the king.
The conspiracy was discovered, and Count Eric Brahe,
Count Jacob Horn and six others of its leaders executed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>A new humiliation to the court was Sweden’s alliance
with Austria, Russia and France against Frederic the Great
of Prussia. The plans laid out by the Swedes were as
elaborate as those for the Russian war. But on account
of poor equipment and repeated change of commanders
nothing effective was done. When peace was made at
Hamburg, in 1762, Sweden neither lost nor gained anything.
The Swedes had fought no battles, and Frederic
the Great said he would call the Swedish invasion of Pomerania
a private fight at the frontier.</p>

<p>The great expense of the profitless war gave the Caps
an occasion to gain in influence, and at the Riksdag of
1765 they overthrew the power of the Hats, in their turn
summarily dismissing the councillors of their opponents.
They introduced perfect liberty of the press in 1766, but
went too far in their policy of economy, dangerously injuring
the new industries by the withdrawal of loans and subsidies.
The expensive factories came to a standstill and
skilled workingmen emigrated. Popular opinion turned
against these repeated changes and the endless strife of
the parties, and felt inclined to criticise a Riksdag which
had attained such power without giving a prosperous and
secure administration in return. Foreign powers, encouraged
by the court, tried to gain adherents of their various
policies by bribes to councillors and members of the Riksdag,
thus demoralizing state politics.</p>

<p>The king received a valuable supporter in the crown
prince Gustavus, who in 1767 became of age. He prevailed
upon the king to resign when the state council refused to call
an extraordinary Riksdag for the granting of added royal
authority. The king did so, and the country was without
a monarch for six days (December 15-21, 1768). The crown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
prince notified the presidents of the different administrative
offices in Stockholm that his father had ceased to reign.
The state council persisted; but had to give in, when the
colonels of the regiments reported that they could no longer
answer for their troops, since also the paymaster’s office was
closed. The Riksdag convened in Norrkœping in 1769.
The Caps suffered defeat in spite of strenuous efforts made
for their preservation by the secret agents of the powers,
anxious to see the anarchic condition of the government
continue. But the court party failed in the exertions to
have the royal privileges augmented. The intrigues of the
foreign powers continued, and the crown prince left for
France to insure her support in case of war. While the
Hats were once more in power, Adolphus Frederic died
suddenly in February, 1771.</p>

<p>Gustavus was to put an end to the party strife of the
“Period of Liberty,” as it has been called. His own reign
belongs properly to it, for he reaped the benefit of the seed
it had been sowing. The Period of Liberty, with all its
faults, forms an important chain in the cultural and political
development of Sweden. Its form of government
made necessary a varied and active part in public affairs,
educating all classes of officials to a high degree of efficiency
and the people at large to self-government. The
Riksdag, through parliamentary activity and importance,
developed an authority which, although too composite
to govern itself, was enabled to act as a shield of steel
against all abuse of the executive power. The national life
never gathered a richer harvest of men of genius who
worked for the progress of their country and for that of
the world. The heroism of the Swedish people during the
preceding period of suffering and distress bore fruit in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
men like Emanuel Swedenborg, the inventor, naturalist,
philosopher and founder of a new religion; Charles
Linnæus; the founder of modern botany; Andrew Celsius,
Junior, the inventor of the centigrade thermometer; John
Ahlstrœmer, the pioneer of industry; John Ihre, the able
philologist, and Olof von Dalin, the poet, humorist, and,
with Sven Lagerbring, the first modern historian of Sweden.
The Period of “Liberty,” viz., of an Aristocratic
Republic, was the golden era of Swedish science, the latter
for the first time becoming of universal fame and of universal
importance. The scientists of this period belong to
the fathers of modern research, basing their conclusions upon
personal observation, in strong contrast to <i>their</i> fathers and
precursors of the chauvinistic barocco period.</p>

<p>Emanuel Swedenborg, the most remarkable man whom
Sweden has ever brought forth, was born in Stockholm,
June 29, 1688. His father was Jesper Svedberg, bishop
of Skara, in West Gothland, and his mother Sara Behm.
The tendency toward mysticism, an inheritance from his
father, was noticed in him at an early age. He has told
of himself that between the age of four and ten his thoughts
were exclusively occupied with religious subjects. While
in prayer, he sometimes entered a somnambulic condition,
revealing things which surprised his parents, who said that
angels spoke through him. As a child, he had the idea of
God as one, without any conception of a Trinity. Later
he received instruction in the systematic theology of his
day. His father gave him a thorough training in the
Oriental and classical languages. The early mysticism of
the boy was supplanted by a thirst for knowledge of the
phenomena of life and nature, coupled to a burning desire
to illustrate his reading by practical experiments. Having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
entered the University of Upsala, he at first devoted himself
to the study of the classical languages and literature, later
to that of mathematics and natural science. When the
university was visited by the plague in 1710, and almost all
courses of instruction were interrupted, Swedenborg made
a journey for scientific purposes to England, Holland,
France and Germany. He returned in 1714, enriched with
valuable results. In 1716-18 he published the first scientific
journal of Sweden, “Dædalus Hyperboreus,” treating
subjects of mathematics and physical science. In 1716 he
came in close personal contact with Charles XII. at the
university town of Lund. The king, being deeply impressed
by his great learning and practical ability, appointed
him assistant assessor of the college of mining. Swedenborg
had, by the scholar Eric Benzelius, been made acquainted
with the idea of the old Bishop Brask, of the time
of Gustavus I., to “cut up the land” between the North Sea
and the Baltic to make a navigable route through Sweden.
Swedenborg gave close attention to this scheme, and communicated
his plans to Charles XII., who became very much
interested in them. Christopher Polhem was selected to
build the great canal, and Swedenborg was made his assistant.
We know from the sketch of Polhem’s life why the
great work failed of accomplishment. Swedenborg gave
a proof of his superior genius as a practical engineer during
the siege of Fredericshall. Tordenskiold made the sea unsafe
and had hedged in the Swedish fleet at Iddefiord. The
Swedish boats and galleys were then carried overland to
the town of Strœmstad, travelling the main road for fifteen
miles on rolling machines devised by Swedenborg. After
the death of Charles XII., whom he highly respected, Swedenborg
travelled to Saxony and Hungary to study the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
mining industry of these countries. Returning in 1722,
he entered for the first time upon his work of the college of
mining, becoming assessor a few years later. In 1719 he
was ennobled with his brothers and sisters, when the change
of name from Svedberg to Swedenborg was made. In 1724
he declined to accept the chair of mathematics at the University
of Upsala, dividing his time between his official
work and his studies, until 1747, when he resigned from
his position with a pension of the same amount as his salary.
His religious works were commenced in 1745, and
after that time he made repeated journeys to London or
Amsterdam to have these printed, as they could not be published
in Sweden on account of the strict and highly orthodox
censure of that period.</p>

<p>In 1744 the event occurred which Swedenborg in various
places of his works has described as the opening of his
spiritual sight, or the manifestations of the Lord to him
in person. He had not, by geometrical, physical and metaphysical
principles, succeeded in grasping the infinite and
the spiritual, or their relation to the nature of man, but he
had touched on facts and methods which seemed to conduct
him in the right direction. He thought that God had led
him into the natural sciences in order to prepare him for his
later spiritual development. The visions of his boyhood
returned, now conceived by a nature enriched by the experiences
of a life spent in ardent and scientific research.
The great seer remained a man whom everybody loved and
respected. People who did not believe in his visions feared
to ridicule them in the presence of this august savant. His
manner of life was simple, his diet chiefly consisting of
bread, milk and large quantities of coffee. He made little
distinction between night and day, and sometimes lay for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
days in a trance. His servants were often disturbed at
night by hearing him engaged in what he called conflicts
with evil spirits. His intercourse with spirits was often
perfectly calm, in broad daylight, and with all his faculties
awake. He held that every man and woman has the same
power of spiritual intercourse, although not developed in
the same degree as it was found in him.</p>

<p>The work which established the scientific reputation of
Swedenborg was published, in 1734, in three massive folios,
at the expense of Duke Ludvig Rudolph of Brunswick.
The second and third volumes describe the best methods
employed in Europe and America in the manufacture of
iron, copper and brass. The first volume contains a philosophical
explanation of the elementary world which has
aroused admiration as a beautiful, daring and consistent
creation of human genius, worthy of being placed side by
side with the works of Newton, and replete with remarkable
ideas and anticipations of later discoveries. Swedenborg
indicated the existence of the seventh planet forty
years before Uranus was discovered by Herschel. He was
the first to form an idea of the development of nebulæ from
chaotic masses to concrete heavenly bodies, a hypothesis
later perfected by Herschel, and the first to offer the theory,
later developed by Buffon, Kant and La Place, of the solar
origin of the planets and their satellites. As in astronomy,
so also in physics and geology he preconceived great discoveries.
His experiments and theories in physics have been
confirmed by the discoveries of the polarity of light and the
galvanometer and its magnetic properties. Swedenborg
discovered before anybody else the great importance of
magnetism and the fact that magnetism and electricity are
manifestations of the same power. He made observations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
concerning air and water which have been confirmed as to
their correctness by Priestley, Cavendish and Lavoisier,
who long were supposed to have been the first discoverers.
In geology, he was the first to demonstrate that the Scandinavian
peninsula, except the southern part of Scania, was
a rising continent, proving the earlier level of the sea to
have been much higher and the inland lakes to have stood
in connection with the sea. Through his remarks on bowlders,
he gave rise to the later theories of Berzelius and
Sæfstrom of a bowlder period. Upon these researches followed
great and remarkable works of anatomy, which, by
later anatomists of the first rank, have been declared to be
classics in the literature of physiology. His immense work,
“Arcana Cœlestia,” and other theosophical writings which
he has placed as a foundation for the New Church, and on
which his present fame rests, were not so celebrated in his
days as his scientific works. Like the latter, they were all
written in Latin.</p>

<p>The new religion, founded by Swedenborg, more spiritual
than the old, has proved equally attractive to the individual
and idealistic thinkers of all sects, Protestants and
Catholics, Unitarians and Theosophists. Swedenborg made
no attempt to establish a sect, and the New Church as an
organization is the result of a movement which was started
after his death.</p>

<p>In his personal appearance Swedenborg was a middle-sized
man of strong constitution. His head was of a fine
shape, the color of his face somewhat dark and its expression
pensive, but his blue eyes were large and radiant. His
disposition was amiable. He was a man of the world, fond
of music and society, especially of that of cultured women,
and was often seen at court. He had a tendency to stutter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
when speaking fast, for which reason he used a slow diction,
characterized by choice and mature expressions. In
his youth, he frequented the house of Christopher Polhem
and fell in love with his daughter Emerentia. Both Polhem
and Charles XII. favored the idea of seeing them
united, the young girl of fourteen giving her consent. But
young Emerentia was secretly in love with somebody else,
and her health and disposition suffered under the strain.
When Swedenborg discovered the truth, he gave his betrothed
freedom from her allegiance. He ceased to visit the
house of Polhem and never entered any other relation of
love.</p>

<p>In 1770, at the age of eighty-two, Swedenborg for the
last time visited Amsterdam. John C. Cuno, who then
saw him, thus described the impression which the aged
visionary and thinker made upon him: “He looked so
touchingly pious, and when I gazed into his smiling eyes
of a heavenly blue, it always seemed to me that truth itself
spoke from his lips.” Swedenborg left Amsterdam for
London, where, on Christmas eve, 1772, he was struck
by hemiplegia. After a few weeks he recovered his speech,
and his faculties were clear to the last. The chaplain of the
Swedish legation asked him if he had not formulated the
doctrines of his new religion in order to gain fame, and if
he wished to recall it all before he died. The yet partly
paralyzed man raised himself into a sitting position, saying:
“As true as it is that you see me here in front of you,
as true is also all that I have written, and in eternity you
will find a confirmation of it.” The chaplain asked him
if he wanted to receive the sacrament. Swedenborg answered:
“I need it not; for I am already a member of the
other world; but your intention is good, and I will with joy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
receive the sacrament in token of the bond of unity between
heaven and earth.” Swedenborg died March 29, 1772, and
was buried in the Lutheran church of London.</p>

<p>Swedenborg was shrewd in worldly affairs and discussed
politics and finance in the Swedish Riksdag for nearly a
score of years after his visions and theological writings had
begun to occupy most of his time.</p>

<p>If the theological works of Emanuel Swedenborg at first
were apt to discredit the results of his manifold scientific
research in the eyes of those who did not share his theosophical
views, the renown of the great religious thinker
in later times has outshone the fame of which, as the versatile
scholar and philosopher, he was so eminently worthy.
With his younger contemporary, Charles Linnæus (or Carl
von Linné), the case was different. There was in his career
no radical change to divert or throw an umbrage over the
fame he had won as a scientist of the very first rank.</p>

<p>Charles Linnæus, the most celebrated of Swedish scientists,
was born at Rashult, in Smaland, in 1707. His father
was a minister of a very subordinate charge of the state
church. The neighborhood in which the young Linnæus
grew up was not fertile, but rich in flowers, which were
the toys and comrades of his childhood. He made but little
progress at his work in the college of Vexio, being more
fond of collecting and examining plants than of studying
Greek and Latin. It was the wish of his parents that he
should become a minister and the assistant of his father;
but the youth had so little inclination to pursue the life or
studies of a clergyman that he at last found it necessary
to tell his parents so. He had found a friend and protector
in Doctor Rothman, a district physician, who encouraged
him to follow his ambition of becoming a naturalist and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
physician. Doctor Rothman supervised his studies in botany
and succeeded in teaching him Latin by giving him
the natural history of Pliny to study. In this manner Linnæus,
who at college showed utter dislike for the classical
languages, learned to write and speak Latin with ease.
His teachers, who at first had advised his parents to let
him quit the book, in order to take up some trade, were
made aware of his gifted nature, but as he was found
deficient in the regular courses, their recommendation,
necessary for his admittance to the University of Lund,
was very carefully worded. “The youths in our colleges
may be likened unto little trees in a plant school, where
it happens, although but rarely, that young trees upon
which the greatest care have been lavished do not turn out
well, but resemble wild stems, yet, when removed and transplanted,
change their wild nature and develop into beautiful
trees of agreeable fruit. Likewise, and for no other purpose,
this youth is sent to the university, where he may
venture into a climate favorable to his growth.” There
was an accurate but unconscious prophecy concealed in this
beautiful “recommendation,” which, curiously enough, has
chosen the similes which were considered indispensable in
the artificial language of the period from the world of
plants, when speaking of the future flower king of the
North.</p>

<p>The young Linnæus made his way to the university
town of Southern Sweden, walking the whole distance from
Vexio to Lund, with a heavy knapsack and a light pocket-book.
He was in hopes to win the protection of his uncle,
the influential dean of the cathedral. Upon entering Lund,
he heard all church bells tolling, and, upon inquiry, learned
that they rang for the funeral of his uncle, the dean! A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
former teacher of his managed to have him enrolled at the
university without having to turn in the diplomatic recommendation
from his college. He took his bachelor’s degree
and was kindly encouraged by Professor Chilian Stobæus,
at whose house he was stopping. The mother of Stobæus
told him to look after the young man from Smaland, who
was in the habit of going to sleep with his candle left burning,
thus liable to “lead the whole house into adventure.”
When the learned professor looked into the matter he found
his own works in the hands of the youth, who spent his
nights reading them. After that all the books and the
heartfelt sympathy of the scholar were at the command
of Linnæus.</p>

<p>In 1728 Linnæus, so advised by his earliest protector,
changed his place of study to the University of Upsala,
which at the time was better equipped and provided with
a fine botanical garden. The young scholar endured a
great deal of suffering for lack of funds, his father no
longer being able to provide for his support. His diet was
very light, and he wrapped his benumbed feet in paper to
keep them from peeping out of his ragged shoes. His
father called him home to reconsider his resolution as to
a ministerial calling. Linnæus was ready to leave and
paid a farewell visit to the botanic gardens. He lingered
in melancholy thoughts before a rare flower which he intended
to pluck. A harsh voice behind commanded him
to leave the flower alone. Linnæus turned and stood face
to face with the dean, Olof Celsius the Elder. In the interview
which followed the young man surprised the dean,
who was an able and enthusiastic botanist, by his exceptional
knowledge of plants. Celsius inquired about his
circumstances and ended by taking him into his house and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
providing for his future. Shortly afterward Linnæus published
a short but important treatise on the sexual life of
plants, which he handed in to Professor Olof Rudbeck the
Younger. This able scholar was forcibly struck by the ingenuity
of the thoughts in the work, which contained the
nucleus to the grand scientific system which Linnæus later
developed. When, in 1730, Rudbeck obtained a vacation he
had Linnæus installed as a lecturer of the botanic gardens.
Shortly afterward Linnæus received the commission to pay
a visit of botanic research to Lapland, on the plants of
which he published a remarkable work. The journey was
made on horseback, the young scholar returning deeply
impressed by the grandeur of natural sceneries in the extreme
North.</p>

<p>Linnæus had to fight poverty and adversity for some
time still. His mother, who always had regretted that he
should “turn out a surgeon instead of a minister,” was elated
over his first triumph when opening the field of a new science
by his sexual system of plants. He suffered all the more at
her death, which he was forced to conceal because he could
not afford a mourning garb. Envious comrades put an end
to his lectures at Upsala by having enforced, through petitions,
an order against the filling of temporary vacancies
by men who had not taken the doctor’s degree. It was
found necessary for Linnæus to go abroad, and some
money was subscribed by his friends for that purpose.
In Holland he met the learned Professor Boerhave, who,
on being made acquainted with his system of botany,
which Linnæus then for the first time published, received
him with tokens of unlimited admiration and friendship.
It was by Boerhave that the continental fame of Linnæus
was founded. The latter found, in the arranging of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
great gardens of Hartekamp intrusted to him, a work both
agreeable and instructive. In London, Linnæus broadened
his experience with study of the rich collections of plants
and naturalia which were made accessible to him by the
celebrated scholar Hans Sloane, later the founder of the
British Museum. The letter of recommendation from Boerhave
was somewhat different to the one Linnæus had received
at Vexio: “Linnæus, who hands you this letter,
is the only one worthy to see you, and to be seen by you.
Those who see you together look upon two men the peers
of which the world does hardly possess.” After a stay in
Paris, where the greatest scientists of France treated him
with distinction, he returned to Holland, to find his friend
Boerhave dying in Leyden. Linnæus kissed the hand of
the dying man, who insisted on kissing the hand of Linnæus
in return, pronouncing him the greater genius, of
whom the world should expect and receive more.</p>

<p>Linnæus, the celebrated founder of a new science, returned
home as an unknown man. His ability as a physician,
acquired at the University of Leyden, and his growing
continental fame soon made him distinguished. In 1741
he was appointed professor of medicine at Upsala, but
changed chairs with the professor of botany. The study
of the latter science was highly developed through the
continued research of Linnæus, and became very popular,
while giving a great impetus to the study of medicine.
The grace and animation of Linnæus as a lecturer caused
students and scholars to flock around him in hundreds.
The botanic excursions led by Linnæus resembled daily
marches of triumphs, the multitude of students escorting
their beloved teacher back to the botanic gardens with
flowers in their hats and with music of drums and French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
horns. Sweden, with Upsala as a centre, was for the first
time in history considered a home of scientific culture, to
which naturalists gathered from all parts of the world,
America included. Pupils of ability and distinction were
sent by Linnæus to strange and unknown quarters, from
which they returned with new and unfamiliar plants, which
were examined and classified by the flower king of the
North. Linnæus was honored by his contemporaries in
such a superlative manner as no one of his countrymen,
before or after, and few other scientists of any age or country.
Count Charles Gustavus Tessin has the credit of having
encouraged him in his work and improved his career
upon his return from the Continent. When ennobled, Linnæus
changed his name to Von Linné, the earlier form
being the more familiar to English readers. King Gustavus
III. presented him with the estate Hammarby, where
he liked to dwell, surrounded by his flowers and his family,
resting from the fatigue caused by the endless stream of
distinguished pilgrims who came to visit his flower court
at Upsala. The offers of foreign monarchs to have him
come and dwell with them were many and liberal. In 1739
he married the love of his youth, Maria Elizabeth Moræus,
“and never since felt an inclination to leave Sweden.”</p>

<p>Linnæus in many respects resembled Swedenborg, being
convinced that his acceptance of truth was the correct one
and disliking disputes. Like Swedenborg, he was pious,
modest, benevolent and sincere. Of his own exterior and
disposition Linnæus has himself given the following characteristic
account: “Linnæus was not tall, not small, lean,
brown-eyed, light, quick, walked briskly, did everything
promptly, disliked slow people, was sensitive, easily moved,
worked continuously and could not spare himself. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
fond of good food and drank good drinks, but never to excess.
He cared little for exteriors, considering that man
should adorn his dress and not vice versa. Faculty meetings
were not his delight, or business, for he was made for
quite other things, and had other things in mind than those
which there were discussed and decided upon.” In the
preface to the late edition of his principal work, “Systema
Naturæ,” the following noteworthy paragraph is found: “I
saw the shadow of the Supreme Being go past me, and
I was seized with respect and admiration. I searched for
His footsteps in the sand&mdash;what power, what wisdom! I
saw how the animals existed only by means of the plants,
the plants by means of the lifeless particles, and these in
their turn constitute the earth. I saw the sun and stars
without number hanging suspended in the air, held by the
hand of the Being of beings, the artist of this grand masterpiece.”</p>

<p>Linnæus died January 10, 1778, and was buried in the
cathedral of Upsala. His botanic system has been superseded
by others, but the influence that his researches and
discoveries have exerted on the natural sciences and medicine,
has not ceased to be benignantly felt, nor have the
utmost results of his researches been as yet attained.</p>

<p>Andrew Celsius, professor of astronomy at Upsala,
acquired fame as a writer on astronomy and was successful
in his efforts to have an observatory built at the university.
In 1742 he introduced his invention, the Celsius
or centigrade thermometer, which is of almost indispensable
practical value in all physical and chemical experiments.
Olof Celsius, Senior, the able botanist, Orientalist and
patron of Linnæus, was his uncle, he thus being a cousin
of Olof Celsius, Junior, whose brightly written histories of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
Gustavus Vasa and Eric XIV. were translated into contemporaneous
French and German.</p>

<p>John Ahlstrœmer accomplished more for the resurrection
of the downtrodden industry of his country than
any one else, and therefore justly deserves the name of the
Father of Swedish Industry. This man, who occupies an
honored place in Swedish history, was born in 1685, of poor
parents, at the town of Alingsos, in West Gothland, his
original name being John Toresson. He worked himself
up in various mercantile positions in Stockholm and other
towns, later coming to London, where he engaged in business
of his own and became an English citizen. He saw
with regret that his countrymen sent their money abroad
to obtain articles which they could manufacture at home,
and was seized with the ambition to introduce into Sweden
the industries which constitute the foundation of England’s
mercantile wealth.</p>

<p>When Charles XII. returned to Sweden, Ahlstrœmer
went there also, trying to win the king to his industrial
plans. He did not succeed, but found in Christopher Polhem
a man who listened to and appreciated them. Ahlstrœmer
intended to return to England, but was captured by
the Danes during the journey. On account of his English
citizenship he soon regained his liberty, visiting England
and the Continent, and carefully selecting everything which
he had in view of sending to Sweden as the requisite instruments
for his plans. This work sometimes involved great
danger, as the buying of looms for hose and ribbon, fulling
vats, dyes, etc.; for the great manufacturing countries were
keeping jealous watch that the secrets of their industries
should not become known abroad. In a town in Holland,
Ahlstrœmer barely missed being pelted with stones by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
mob. Pursued by the revenue authorities, he managed to
escape with his ship, arriving safely in Gothenburg with
the valuable cargo and skilled laborers in his employ.
Shortly afterward he arrived in his native town of Alingsos,
where the industrial enterprises were established. The
Riksdag at first was unwilling to grant him the necessary
concessions, the clergy especially being averse to allow so
many foreign workingmen free confession of their Catholic
religion. In 1724 the concessions were at last obtained, and
Ahlstrœmer began his course, which he was resolved should
result in the fostering of the same industrial activity in his
impoverished country, which he, with surprise, had noticed
in England and on the Continent.</p>

<p>In establishing his enterprises, Ahlstrœmer exhausted
his resources, and when he tried to form a company to keep
them going he was met with stubborn resistance, caused
by ignorance and jealousy. He succeeded at last in obtaining
the financial backing of some wealthy mine owners of
Vermland, who took shares in his enterprises. The Riksdag
of 1726 encouraged him by placing high protective or
prohibitive tariffs on foreign articles which could be produced
in the country. In the following year King Frederic
paid a visit to Alingsos, spending a whole day in looking
over the mills and factories. The king said that
he would rather own the stock of goods of Ahlstrœmer
than the largest arsenal in his kingdom, and saw to it that
his servants were dressed in broadcloth manufactured at
Alingsos.</p>

<p>Alingsos saw its population suddenly increase from 300
to 1,800 and entered upon an era of prosperity. Ahlstrœmer’s
factories formed almost a little town of their own beside
the older one. There were twelve looms for the manufact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>uring
of broadcloth, forty-five looms for wool, and, besides,
cotton mills, dye works for wool and silk, hose factories,
an English tannery and various other industrial works. Also
a foundry, with eight communicating shops, where all kinds
of household articles of simple and composite metals were
manufactured. Alingsos was made a kind of normal school
of industry for the whole country. The foreign master
workmen, who at the beginning had charge of the factories,
instructed in time a great number of native apprentices, who
later found employment elsewhere, thus distributing to
various parts the experience obtained at Alingsos. Wool
was the principal material in the factories, and in order
to obtain a refined quality, Ahlstrœmer imported stocks of
foreign breeds. He commenced with English sheep, the
Riksdag of 1727 granting him the use of the royal estate
Hœjentorp for the purpose. Angora goats were later imported
and seemed to thrive.</p>

<p>Ahlstrœmer did his country a great service by introducing
the cultivation of potatoes. The first shipment of
this useful plant arrived in 1723, with workingmen imported
from France. As soon as the plant was seen to stand the
climate, larger quantities were sent for. Potatoes were
cultivated in the vast fields around Alingsos at a period
when they were exhibited in the botanic gardens of the Continent
as rare plants from Peru. Prejudice at first interfered,
but when the soldiers returned home from Pomerania
with the habit of eating potatoes, and planted such
around their cottages, the popularity of the Peruvian plant
was assured. Ahlstrœmer also introduced the cultivation
of tobacco and several dye plants. The coal mines, near
Helsingborg, in Scania, commenced to be operated at his
instigation. When the Academy of Science was instituted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
in 1739, Ahlstrœmer was made one of its members. The
Academy of Science served originally and in that era of
utilitarianism a more practical purpose than later. The
Cap administration of Arvid Horn gave comparatively little
attention to the enterprises of Ahlstrœmer, having more
in view to develop agriculture than industry. When the Hats
got into power the conditions were reversed. Count Charles
Gyllenborg, the successor of Arvid Horn as president of the
chancery, in order to set a good example, always dressed in
broadcloth of Swedish manufacture. Ahlstrœmer was
made a councillor of commerce, and ennobled, while his bust
was placed in the Exchange of Stockholm and medals issued
in his honor by the Academy of Science.</p>

<p>Ahlstrœmer was a middle-sized man of a strong constitution.
He was amiable, courteous and hospitable, ever
ready to conduct visitors through his factories and warehouses.
His energy was as great as his kindness, and he
refused to recognize an enemy in anybody. The large
profits of his plants he mostly spent on other patriotic
enterprises, leaving hardly any other inheritance to his sons
than an excellent education. During the last few years
of his life he suffered the consequences of a stroke of paralysis.
He died in 1761, and thus was saved from witnessing
the destruction which was caused to the new factory
industry and his own works at Alingsos by the reckless
policy of the new Caps.</p>

<p>Olof Dalin is the principal poet and writer of the Period
of Liberty, strongly influencing not only the creative minds
of his own day, but also those who with more or less right
have been counted as belonging to the Gustavian Period.
Dalin was the son of a minister in the province of Halland
and a relative of Professor Andrew Rydelius of Lund, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
historian of the older generation, who conducted the course
of his studies. He came to Stockholm in 1726, where several
positions in various state departments afforded opportunity
for study in libraries and archives. Dalin, from
the year 1732 to 1734, published a magazine called “The
Swedish Argus,” which, with the English “Spectator” as
a pattern, contained articles on public and individual morals,
with allusions to the facts of contemporary life. This publication
caused a great stir and became very popular on
account of the acute logic and excellent language of its
editor. Dalin was appointed royal librarian by the Riksdag,
and, on the recommendation of Count Tessin, teacher
to the young crown prince Gustavus.</p>

<p>Dalin was an enthusiastic admirer of the glorious epoch of
Swedish history and of the character of Charles XII., which
caused him to join the party of the Hats. When the latter
utterly failed in their attempts to restore the political grandeur
of the past, and Dalin witnessed the excesses of the
rivalling parties, he joined the secret agitators for an increased
royal power. In the literary and artistic circle of
the brilliant Queen Louise Ulrica, Dalin was the leading
spirit. He was not unaware of the conspiracies and intrigues
of the queen, and is supposed to have been the author
of several of the sharp notes which the king added to the
records of the state council. The Hats, who took offence
at his sharp satires, made him resign from his position as
the teacher of the crown prince. After the conspiracy
of the court party was detected, Dalin was called before a
committee of the Estates and by order dismissed from the
court. Dalin used the time of his compulsory isolation for
the writing of a history of Sweden. This work, which
never was carried further than to the end of the Period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
of Reformation, is characterized by an attractive style,
but is not reliable as to facts.</p>

<p>Dalin was allowed to return to the court in 1761. He
stood in great favor and was covered with testimonials of
appreciation. He died in 1763, at the moment when King
Adolphus Frederic was resolved to make him a state councillor.
Dalin was the first writer who made Swedish history
popular, and exerted, by his poems and his magazine,
and by his education of Gustavus III., a considerable influence
upon the history of his own time.</p>

<p>In point of scientific research the historical works of
Sven Lagerbring have a much higher value than Dalin’s
history, although they lacked the literary excellence of
the latter. Lagerbring, who, born in Scania, was professor
of history at the University of Lund, carried his work to the
times of Charles VIII. A shorter history of his was translated
into French and long formed the chief source of continental
knowledge of Swedish history.</p>

<p>As a poet Dalin had a rival in the somewhat younger
Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht, one of the most interesting
characters in Swedish history of literature. Her works,
chiefly consisting of lyrics and idyls, show a long chain
of development from the taste of the Carolinian period to
that of the Gustavian epoch. In her deep emotional nature
and enthusiasm for all cultural movements she stands without
a rival. Receiving an annuity from the government,
she was after many adversities able to maintain a literary
salon. The men who met there, like Gustavus Philip
Creutz and Gustavus Frederic Gyllenborg, were the founders
of an academic style in poetry, as was Charles Gustavus
Tessin in eloquence.</p>

<p>John Ihre is perhaps the most highly gifted of Swedish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
philologists and the first whose research had a lasting scientific
value. He stood at the summit of contemporary European
study of language, and rose a head or more higher
than the philologists of his own country in that day. The
period was characterized by a movement for the purification
and analyzation of the language, Dalin expressing his wish
to speak the truth to the Swedes in pure Swedish, and the
Academy of Science taking pride in publishing their important
papers in the mother tongue. Eric Benzelius, an able
critic of the Gothic, and interested in Swedish dialect research,
was one of the precursors of Ihre; and so was Olof
Celsius, Senior, professor of Greek, later of Oriental languages,
who was the first to fix the age of the majority
of Runic inscriptions as dating from the Christian era.</p>

<p>John Ihre was born, in 1707, in Lund, where his father
was a professor of theology, a talented, witty and learned
man. The young Ihre lost his father in 1720, after which
time his uncle, Archbishop Steuchius of Upsala, had charge
of his education. He later studied modern languages at the
University of Jena, made the acquaintance of the contemporary
philologists of Holland, and also studied at the universities
of London, Oxford and Paris. After an absence
of three years he returned, soon to be connected with the
University of Upsala, where he remained for forty-two
years as professor of rhetoric and politics. Ihre was a liberal,
outspoken man, who was severely censured for his opinions
upon political and religious subjects, once by the Riksdag
being sentenced to pay fines and receiving a warning from the
chancellor of the university. When the clergy upon another
occasion warned the philosophers not to mix in theological
subjects, Ihre defended himself in the following terms in
a letter to the chancellor, Count Charles Gustavus Tessin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
“Gracious lord! I teach <i>eloquentiam</i>, <i>politicam</i> and the
states, with all things pertaining to them. To become a
heretic I possess neither genius nor stupidity enough, less
an evil purpose. Therefore I am willing to forego all theology,
if only an allowance of it be made large enough for
my private practice and edification in Christianity. I never
intended to go any further.”</p>

<p>Ihre left religion and politics alone, and received many
high distinctions in return for his great scientific merits.
When ennobled, he kept his old family name, stating that
he was “somewhat known abroad under the name of Ihre,”
while if he changed it to Gyllenbiorn or Vargstierna, it
would take “some time to announce this new disguise.”
He was renowned for his ready wit, and wielded a considerable
influence in academic circles. Ihre was satisfied
with his position and his science, and was not willing to
exchange them for a political career.</p>

<p>Ihre was led to the study of the Teutonic languages in
their oldest forms by his desire to find a consistent spelling
and correct understanding of the words in his own language.
He was desirous of freeing it from foreign words,
but only when those substituted were as expressive and
comprehensible as the old. Ihre was a pioneer in the field
of dialect lexicographers, publishing the outline of a Swedish
dialect dictionary in 1766, and wrote a number of works
pertaining to the historic forms of Gothic, Lappish, Finnish
and Old Norse. Special importance is due to his epoch-making
research concerning the language of the Codex Argenteus.
He once for all settled the controversy, proving
the Codex to contain the Gothic Bible translation of Bishop
Wulfila against the assertions of M. Lacroze of Berlin, who
claimed that it was written in Frankish. In regard to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
Edda of Snorre Sturleson, he declared it to be intended as
an introductory study of poesy, a handbook of poetics for
young scalds, an opinion which has been fully established
in a much later time. By these and other theories Ihre
attained a much higher standpoint as a scientific critic than
his contemporaries. He spoke of the resemblance between
the Teutonic and the classical languages, without being able
to find the reasons. He even to some extent anticipated the
great discovery which after its formulator has been called
Grimm’s Law, by pointing out “a certain regularity of consonant
shift” in the Teutonic languages.</p>

<p>The monumental work of Ihre and the crowning effort
of his life was prepared between the years 1750-1759. This
Glossarium suiogothicum, published at the expense of the
government, is the best Swedish dictionary of the eighteenth
century. Ihre by his severe critical method kills
the wild etymologies of the “Rudbeckian philology,” turning
to Old Swedish for the derivations, and, where this gave
no satisfaction, to the Old Icelandic, “because this language
nine hundred years ago was separated from our own and
has remained undisturbed by foreign influence.” From the
Old Northern dialects he turned to Old High German, Old
English and Gothic, the last mentioned of which he considered
the mother of the Teutonic languages. Many of
Ihre’s etymologies have not been able to withstand the
scrutiny of later criticism, but his great etymological dictionary
is the product of versatile knowledge and unusual
insight, and has not only exerted a profound influence upon
his own period but also served as a model for later epochs
of philological research.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Gustavian Period&mdash;Gustavus III. and Gustavus IV.
Adolphus</i></span></h2>

<p>Gustavus III., with his brilliant endowment, one
of the most illustrious, and, in spite of his glaring
faults, one of the most beloved, of Swedish monarchs,
was the first king since Charles XII. who was born
in Sweden. For this very reason, and on account of his
amiable and charming disposition, he had won for himself
the sympathy of the people even before his succession to the
throne. This nephew of Frederic the Great of Prussia had
inherited the genius, ambition and pride of his gifted mother,
all enlarged and intensified, and the gentleness and good
nature of his father. He was in every particular a child
of his time, and every inch a king. Gustavus was decidedly
French in education, taste and superficiality, but had by his
first teacher Dalin been inspired with a deep love of his
country, its history, language and traditions. He handled
the Swedish and French languages with equal skill, and
a more eloquent monarch has never graced a throne. He
was passionately fond of theatricals and impressive ceremony,
and, like his mother and illustrious uncle, he surrounded
himself with men of genius. Gustavus was betrothed
to Princess Sophie Magdalene of Denmark when
only four years of age, and married her when twenty. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
union was arranged by the Riksdag, contrary to the wish
of Gustavus’s parents. Gustavus appeared at first to be
deeply in love with the gentle and unpretentious princess,
but she soon found herself as neglected by her consort as
she was detested by his mother. The crown prince early
began to hate the form of government which had brought
so much humiliation to his parents. This absolutism of the
Riksdag, which could be bought and sold through bribery
by foreign powers, he considered dangerous to the independence
and welfare of the country, and was resolved to
change the balance of power to the hands of the king,
of whose dignity and importance he held an exalted opinion.</p>

<p>At the death of his father, Gustavus was in France,
returning with the agreement of a secret alliance. At the
Riksdag of 1771, where the Caps once more came into
power, Gustavus III. signed a pledge with new restrictions
of the royal authority. But while the king officially seemed
to desire a pacification of both parties, and his time was
principally occupied with theatricals, embroideries and costumes,
he was secretly arranging a conspiracy. He was
crowned in May, 1772, and in August the news of a revolt
in Scania, led by John Christian Toll, reached the capital.
The king feigned surprise, but waited for similar news from
Finland, whence Jacob Magnus Sprengtporten was to bring
troops to Stockholm. As Sprengtporten’s movements were
somewhat delayed, the king had to take action himself.
In the morning of August 19th he entered the officers’ hall
of the body-guards, where he delivered a patriotic address,
asking the officers to follow him as their ancestors had followed
Gustavus Vasa and Gustavus Adolphus. He was
greeted with an enthusiasm which soon spread throughout
the capital, assuring the king of perfect loyalty. The state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
councillors were quickly arrested and order given that no one
should be allowed to leave the capital. The Riksdag was
called together August 21st, and addressed by the king in
an eloquent speech which gave a striking view of the situation
and its perils. He declared that he was not going to
touch liberty, only to abolish misrule by the establishment
of a firm administration. Then was read the proposition
for a constitution which the king had prepared. The king
alone was to be the executive, appointing higher officials
and councillors, making alliances with foreign powers, but
not commencing any war of attack without the consent of
the Riksdag. The state council was to consist of seventeen
members with deliberative, but no executive, power. The
Riksdag was to convene at the order of the king, taxation
and legislation to be decided on by the king and Riksdag
in common. The judicial power of all committees was to be
abolished. The Riksdag accepted the royal propositions,
and one of the most smoothly and skilfully managed <i>coups
d’état</i> ever attempted was accomplished, much to the dismay
of Russia, Prussia and Denmark. During half a score
of years the country enjoyed a happy peace, the king winning
the love of his people and being active in administrative
improvements.</p>

<p>Gustavus III. was intensely interested in literature and
art, and a writer of considerable ability, composing
dramatic works of French pattern but with patriotic subjects.
In his best creations he is influenced by Shakespeare.
Among the poets whom he encouraged were Kellgren, Leopold,
Creutz, Gyllenborg, Oxenstierna, Adlerbeth, the creators
of a classical school of Swedish poetry and drama,
influenced by the contemporary French writers. Above
these towers Charles Michael Bellman, who, with his com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>posite
and rich endowment, became the first great national
poet, and of an originality as remarkable as that of any
genius in the literature of the world. The humor introduced
into Swedish literature through the contact with the
songs of the Edda, in Bellman reaches its perfection, while
his poetry in exquisite and triumphant grace of form outrivals
that of his classical contemporaries. His poems were
almost all produced under the inspiration of the moment,
even if later remodelled, and sung to the lute to melodies
of the day, or of his own composition. His impressionistic
power of description leads the thought to the modern
artists, while his ambition to unite the arts of poetry,
music and plastics makes him a precursor of Neo-Romanticism.
There is not one accent of chauvinism, not even a
note of patriotism, in his songs, yet he is the most beloved
of Swedish poets, recognized as the highest exponent of the
lyrico-rhetorical temperament of his people, a mixture of
melancholy humor and exuberant joy in a graceful yet
stately form. Anne Marie Lenngren was a highly talented
poetess, who preserves the classic form for her verse, in
which she ridicules the faults and vices of her period. Thorild
and Lidner were men of great genius, but of somewhat
bizarre and neglected literary form, influenced by contemporary
Romanticism in Germany. Sweden continues to
add a number of names to the galaxy of men distinguished
in the service of natural science, those of Bergman and
Scheele, the founders of modern chemistry, being the most
renowned. To the Academy of Science and Academy of
Art, established during the Period of Liberty, Gustavus
added a Swedish Academy and a National Theatre for the
encouragement of poetry, eloquence, music and drama.
It is during this period that the Swedish language devel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>oped
the beauty and plasticity for which it holds the first
rank among Teutonic dialects, and is considered one of the
most musical languages of the world. Of artists, the painters
Hœrberg, Hillestrœm and Roslin rose to great continental
fame, while Sergel, through the genius and tendencies
of his works one of the most remarkable sculptors of
modern times, won renown for his name, but hardly the
very highest perfection within his possibilities. His statue
of Gustavus III. is the finest monument of Stockholm.</p>

<p>Sweden, so rich in great poets, artists and scientists,
is poor in philosophers, content with the systems of thinkers
in more favored countries. Swedenborg is an important
exception to this rule. Not satisfied with an original system,
with pure reason as the fundamental principle, he divined a
system in which philosophy and religion are inseparably
united. Kant, when made acquainted with Swedenborg’s
earlier system, was utterly astonished, expressing fear that
he himself had been an object of thought-transference,
when writing his celebrated work, “Kritik der reinen Vernunft.”
The system of Descartes was followed by Swedish
philosophers of the Carolinian epoch. During the Period
of Liberty and the reign of Gustavus III., Locke, Voltaire
and Diderot were supreme. At the close of the eighteenth
century, Kant began to exert great influence, Benjamin
Hœijer being his talented and individualistic disciple, and
enjoying the reputation of having been Sweden’s greatest
original thinker. Charles August Ehrensverd, an able warrior
and statesman of the Gustavian epoch, devised an
attractive and novel, although slightly dilettantic, system
of his own, the Philosophy of Fine Arts.</p>

<p>The suspicions that Gustavus III. was not satisfied with
the share of power which he obtained in 1772, and that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
was anxious to gain fame by the means of war, were found
to be justified. In 1786 he called a Riksdag, at which most
of his propositions, to his great surprise, were stubbornly
opposed. Catherine II. of Russia was intriguing with the
Finnish nobles for the purpose of establishing the independence
of Finland under Russian protection. But she was
careful not to commence hostilities. Attempts made by
Gustavus III. to bring the Norwegian people in revolt
against Denmark failed. And so Gustavus, who had no
authority to begin a war of attack, arranged for a simulated
Russian assault on the Finnish boundary, executed by Finnish
peasants in disguise. He declared war on Russia, in
June, 1788, although nobody was found willing to believe
in the feigned cause of it. The actual hostilities were
opened by a brilliant naval battle at Hogland, fought with
success by the Swedish fleet under command of Prince
Charles, the brother of the king, against the Russians.
The king had arrived in Finland resolved to attack St.
Petersburg, which plan he was obliged to change. All
further operations came to a sudden standstill through
mutiny among the Finnish officers in the royal camp at
Anjala, 113 of them signing a document in which they
pledged themselves to force the king to make peace and to
convoke the Riksdag. Another document offering peace
and a union of Finland to Russia was despatched to St.
Petersburg with Jægerhorn, one of the leaders. The officers
received a favorable answer from Russia, which
was handed to the king, and the whole army was made
acquainted with the proceedings. The king found himself
in a most perilous position, out of which he was
saved as by a miracle. Denmark declared war, and the
king hastened to embrace the opportunity to leave with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
honor the trap in which his life and liberty were in
danger.</p>

<p>Gustavus III. sent word to several provinces, asking the
inhabitants to rise in defence of their country. He went
himself to Dalecarlia, where he addressed the peasants when
coming from church, as had Gustavus Vasa. Everywhere
the population rose in arms. The king hastened to Gothenburg,
which was threatened by the Danes, and had the city
strongly fortified. England and Prussia sided with Sweden,
and the Danes found it best to retire from Swedish territory.</p>

<p>Gustavus had won the game. Now for the stakes! He
called a Riksdag in 1789. Through his personal courage
and patriotism, Gustavus III. had recaptured the love of
his people. The nobility was hated and despised on account
of its responsibility for the mutiny at Anjala and for its
intrigues with Russia. Gustavus III. consequently stood
exceedingly well with the three lower Estates of the Riksdag,
but lost their respect through the many violations of
the law which he committed in forcing upon the Riksdag
a new constitution which made him a ruler with almost
absolute power. The nobility stubbornly refused to accept
any change in the constitution. There were many stormy
scenes, both among the nobles and in the presence of the
king, who also paid a visit to the Riddarhus, which he left
with the statement that the nobles were willing to subscribe,
the latter loudly protesting. Axel von Fersen the Elder and
several other aristocratic leaders were held in a prolonged
arrest. Archbishop Troil told the king that he did not wish
to be the first archbishop after Gustavus Trolle to sell the
liberty of his country, and begged to be excused from being
present at the deliberations. The poet and royal favorite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
Adlerbeth, himself a nobleman, pleaded in the Riksdag the
right of his Estate to take action on the royal propositions.
These were in private signed by the speakers of the four
Estates and pronounced by the government as accepted, and
were called an “Act of Union and Security.” This new
constitution gave almost absolute power to the king. The
state council was once more, and forever, swept away and
not even mentioned in the constitution. It was divided into
a supreme court and a department for “the preparation
of public affairs.” By taking half of their members only
from the nobility, the greatest privilege of that class was
annulled. To the peasants was extended the privilege of
buying land originally belonging to the nobility. By hard
pressure, and in opposition to the nobles, the king forced the
Riksdag to take the responsibility for the state debt, which
had increased considerably.</p>

<p>Gustavus III. opened the Riksdag as the most popular
man of the country. He closed it as an absolute sovereign
who had lost the love of his people and aroused the revengeful
hatred of the nobility. Gustavus III. was now enabled
to continue the Russian war at will. His sub-commander
Stedingk won a victory over the Russians at Porosalmi,
the latter being led by Sprengtporten, the former supporter
of Gustavus III., now a soldier of Empress Catherine. He
was killed in the battle. Prince Charles won a victory at
Œland, but was by negligence of his sub-commander detained
from reaping its benefits, Charles August Ehrensverd
defeated a superior Russian naval force at Svensksund
with the “Skerry Fleet,” the creation of his father, Augustinus
Ehrensverd. At the order of the king, he then met
a still larger fleet and was defeated. Dissatisfied with the
king and the result, the valiant hero and philosopher made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
his report in the following laconic phrase: “Your majesty
has no longer any Skerry Fleet,” and resigned from his
position as admiral-general. In the following year, 1780,
the combined naval forces of Sweden were shut up by the
Russian fleet in the bay of Viborg, and seemed doomed to
destruction. But the king gave orders that all the ships
should force a passage, and this heroic effort was successfully
made, through the lines of colossal Russian warships
chained together. The Russian losses were great, and also
those of the Swedes, on account of an explosion on board one
of the ships. The Russians were anxious to gain the victory
that escaped them at Viborg, and decided on July 9th,
the day of Empress Catherine’s coronation, as an appropriate
date. The battle was fought at Svensksund, and
turned into a humiliating defeat, the Russians losing 53
ships, 643 cannon and 14,000 men, and the imperial flag
of state; twenty-six of these ships were entered in the
Swedish navy. Peace was made at Værælæ a month later.
No change of territory was involved, but an end was put to
Russian intrigues, and Sweden had once more and forever
demonstrated her power of taking care of her independence.</p>

<p>The revolution in France made a deep impression upon
the factions which in Sweden were secretly continuing their
struggle. The nobility, in their aristocratic republicanism,
sided with the revolutionists, while the king, an intimate
friend of Louis XVI., tried to save the monarchy. Gustavus
III. left Sweden in the summer of 1791, in order to
receive Louis XVI. and his family at the frontier, while
Count Axel von Fersen the Younger, a son of the old aristocratic
party leader who had taken part with distinction
in the American revolutionary war, was very near to saving
the royal family through a flight from Paris. King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
Gustavus III. waited in vain for the royal fugitives, but
commenced active operations for the forming of an alliance
between Sweden, Russia, Prussia, Austria and Spain
against republican France. Sweden and Russia made a
treaty of mutual defence, but the negotiations for a general
alliance were not at a favorable point when Gustavus
III. himself fell by the aristocratic republicans of his own
country.</p>

<p>A conspiracy between the nobles had been formed, the
majority being men of the highest station. Jacob John
Anckarstrom, a retired officer, was found willing to commit
the deed of killing the hated despot. After several unsuccessful
attempts, the act was accomplished at a mask ball
in the Royal Opera, the king being shot through the hip.
All of the accomplices present were arrested, and, much
to their disappointment, the king not dying instantly, their
plan for a revolution was thus frustrated. Gustavus III.
was shot March 16, 1792, and died March 26, 1792, suffering
his fate with fortitude and great presence of mind. He
appointed his brother Charles and his favorite, Charles Gustavus
Armfelt, members of the government during the
minority of his son, Gustavus Adolphus.</p>

<p>The devotion of his country returned to Gustavus III.
at his deathbed, never to leave him. In spite of his superficiality,
violation of the law, disregard for a constitutional
government, and adventurous and expensive wars, solid
reasons remain to love and respect his memory. His noble
patriotism, frank heroism, brilliant genius and great generosity
are worthy of high praise. His revolution of 1789
brought disastrous consequences, but he furthered the
progress of democracy by annihilation of the aristocratic
republic and saved his country from the tragic fate of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
Poland. Even if the Period of Liberty is to be credited
for a great deal of the cultural development during his
reign, Gustavus has a large share therein, and Esaias
Tegnér is right in his eulogy when he says:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“There rests o’er Gustav’s days a golden shimmer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fantastic, foreign, frivolous, if you please;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But why complain when <i>sunshine</i> caused the glamour?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where stood we now if it were not for these?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All culture on an unfree ground is builded,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And barbarous once the base of patriotism true;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But wit was planted, iron-hard language welded,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The song was raised, life more enjoyed and shielded,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what Gustavian was, is, therefore, Swedish too.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the mixture of patriotism and unreserved cosmopolitanism,
true genius and superficiality, earnestness and recklessness
in the character of Gustavus III., the Swedes have
recognized peculiarities of their own national temperament,
for which they are tempted to love him as dearly, although
not considering him to be as great, as his two predecessors
and namesakes on the Swedish throne. By his eloquence,
wit and amiability, his personality charmed even his enemies.
In contrast to the sombre autocrats of the Barocco
period, Gustavus III. was a typical Rococo monarch, and
he tried to give the charms and grace of the Rococo epoch
to his surroundings. In appearance, he was of middle size,
slender and graceful, with a face which bespoke genius, and
eyes of unusual size and brilliancy.</p>

<p><i>Gustavus IV. Adolphus</i> was a boy of thirteen at the
death of his father. His uncle, Prince Charles, was regent
in name, but Baron Reuterholm, the latter’s favorite, was
the real head of the government. Compared to the eccentric
but energetic, generous and liberal despotism of Gustavus
III., Reuterholm’s was a rule of pettiness, incapa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>bility,
revenge and hypocrisy. Prince Charles was a good
soldier, but early lost all energy through dissipation and
a natural tendency to mysticism, secrecy and simulation.
Reuterholm was a good worker, but of no ability as a statesman,
sharing and increasing the love of mysticism and
superstition characteristic of his master. The new policy
was to estrange the friends and favorites of Gustavus III.
as much as possible, they all being sent away under various
pretexts. Prince Charles had from the start declared invalid
the postscript of the king’s will, according to which
Count Armfelt was to take part in the government. Later
a conspiracy, with Armfelt as the leader, was detected,
when he, who was abroad and later entered Russian service,
was declared to have forfeited his property, rank and life.
A young woman, Lady Madelaine Rudenschiold, who was
one of the conspirators, was punished by being exhibited
to the mob on the place of execution and afterward imprisoned.</p>

<p>Prince Charles was criticised for the leniency shown
toward his brother’s murderers, perhaps without justice,
for the dying king had pleaded clemency in their behalf.
Only Anckarstrom was executed, the other conspirators
all receiving surprisingly mild sentences. This was contrasted
to the petty and revengeful hatred shown the opponents
of the new government, and one now recalled the
fact that Gustavus III. in his last moments had refused
to see the prince. That Charles also had aspirations of his
own seems evident from the fact that he had the young
king examined by physicians, raising doubt as to his physical
and mental fitness to ever take a hand in the government.</p>

<p>Reuterholm made himself hated and ridiculous by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
pettiness. Thus restrictions were placed on extravagance
in food and clothing, the use of coffee for some time being
entirely prohibited. The Swedish Academy was disbanded
because it did not make Reuterholm a member. The liberty
of the press was extended and then suddenly restricted.
Thorild, the writer and poet, was exiled for agitation
against the old division of the Riksdag into four houses,
“because its four Estates always have been bringing about
one unsettled state.” Characteristic of the opinion of Reuterholm’s
administration are the words which the warrior
and philosopher, Charles August Ehrensverd, gave him in
the course of a quarrel between the two: “Monsieur is ambitious
to govern, but monsieur does not know how.” The
best things accomplished during this period were the establishment
of a military academy at Carlberg, and improvements
of the Bible translation and the ritual and hymn-book
of the church.</p>

<p>The attitude toward France was changed with the
change of government, Sweden being the first power to
recognize the French republic. With that country and
Denmark close intimacy was formed, which enraged Russia
and England. In order to pacify the empress, old negotiations
for a marriage between King Gustavus Adolphus and
Alexandra, a niece of Empress Catherine II., were reopened
and a decision reached. The king left for St. Petersburg.
When the great ceremony was to take place, the empress
sat there waiting with her brilliant court for several hours.
No Gustavus Adolphus appeared. In the last moment he
had been asked by a priest to grant his future consort,
Alexandra, liberty to practice her Greek Catholic faith in
public, which he refused to do, thus dropping the whole
matter. The indignant empress was suddenly taken ill and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
died a few weeks later. Soon afterward the king married
the beautiful princess Frederica of Bade.</p>

<p>Gustavus IV. Adolphus was declared of age and took
charge of the government when eighteen (in 1796). Reuterholm
was dismissed, and Prince Charles retired. The king
surrounded himself with the friends of his father, Armfelt
and Toll being recalled, the latter taking excellent care of
foreign affairs, as far as his authority went. But Gustavus
IV. ruled alone, without favorites or influential advisers.
This was most unfortunate, for he was entirely without the
gifts of a regent. He was a lover of order, economy, justice
and pure morals, but through lack of mental and physical
strength his good qualities were misdirected. His
father’s tragic fate had a sinister influence upon his mind,
the equilibrium of which was shaken also by the outrages
of the revolutionists in France. Of a morbid sensibility,
and without inclination to confide in any one, his religious
mysticism led him into a state close to insanity. He imagined
himself to be a reincarnation of Charles XII., while
in Napoleon he recognized the monster of the Apocalypse,
which he himself was sent to fight and conquer.</p>

<p>Gustavus IV. went to an extreme in his fear of liberal
movements, placing severe censorship on the periodical
press, book market and universities. Benjamin Hœijer,
the great philosopher, for some time left his chair at Upsala
and the country. A man who was resolved to “go even
to the doors of hell in search of truth” could not be in sympathy
with the bigot despot. Hard times, produced by
failure of crops and fisheries, and by maritime losses during
the war between England and France, threw added umbrage
over the reign of Gustavus IV. He convoked a
Riksdag, in 1800, in order to raise money to cover the debts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
involved by his predecessor. He never repeated the experiment.
The nobles sanctioned the absolute rule, but stormy
sessions ensued over the royal propositions, six nobles resigning
from titles and privileges, six others their seats
in the Riksdag. The peasants, almost as unyielding, were
pacified by Toll. By his own authority, the king mortgaged
the Swedish city of Wismar, in Mecklenburg, to the
ruler of said duchy for a period of one hundred years, in
receipt for a sum of some two million dollars.</p>

<p>There was no question in which the insanity of the king
became more apparent or disastrous than in his foreign
policy. An alliance of armed neutrality between Sweden,
Russia and Denmark came to naught through the inactivity
of Gustavus IV., and he stubbornly refused to
accept the repeated offers of Napoleon of an alliance with
France in the combat with the powers. Things took a
sinister aspect when an intimate alliance was effected between
Napoleon and Alexander of Russia, in 1807. Napoleon
had lost patience with the lunatic king, and tried to
call forth a catastrophe by urging Alexander to capture
Finland, which he at first was unwilling to do. The French
invaded Swedish Pomerania, and Toll was able to save the
little Swedish army of 10,000 only by means of a most skilful
diplomacy. Denmark, attacked by England, declared
war against Sweden. Gustavus IV. made great preparations,
sending Armfelt with one army to the Norwegian
frontier and Toll with another to Scania. The regular
army counted 100,000 men, and a great force of militia was
organized. But through gross incapability of the government
the majority of troops were never used, the militia
suffering immensely through neglect and hunger.</p>

<p>Czar Alexander at last decided to capture Finland. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
called it himself an act of bad faith and treason against a
relative and ally, and in a treacherous way he carried on his
preparations. The Swedish ambassador was misled as to
the object of the latter, and when informed received exaggerated
accounts as to the force which was to invade Finland.
Gustavus IV. was alarmed and gave the old and
incapable field-marshal, Klingspor, appointed to command
the army in Finland, directions to save his troops in the best
way possible. And so commenced, in February, 1808, the
war which after a heroic struggle was to separate the Finns
from their Swedish brethren. Not only were the Finnish
troops possessed of the noblest patriotic spirit, but they had
also courageous and distinguished commanders, who, if
duly supported and intrusted with more authority, would
probably have been able to ward off the attack. Conspicuous
among the latter were C. J. Adlercreutz, born in Finland,
the hero of Siikajoki, Lappo and Oravais; G. C. von
Dœbeln, the victor of Juutas, and J. A. Sandels, the hero
of Pulkkila, Indensalmi and Virta, all three of them veterans
from the war of Gustavus III.</p>

<p>The aged General Klercker commanded a Finnish army
at Tavastehus, where Klingspor arrived with his royal orders,
which were for retreat and evacuation of the country. The
troops were deprived of their hopes of a battle and forced
to make a retreat of nearly 600 miles, suffering from cold
and hunger. The retreat continued without interruption
for two months, until the army, in April, found itself between
Brahestad and Uleoborg. A battle was fought at
Siikajoki, April 18th, the sub-commander, General Adlercreutz,
receiving instructions to make a stand against the
enemy until the safety of the army supplies could be insured.
After five hours of fighting, the Finns won a glo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>rious
victory over the Russians. But royal orders for a
continued retreat arrived, and the Russians took possession
of Siikajoki.</p>

<p>As long as Sveaborg, the Gibraltar of the North, was
safe, the final outcome of the struggle must remain undecided.
Sveaborg, the creation of Augustinus Ehrensverd,
is situated on seven islets and consists of several strong
works partly cut out of the rock and in an admirable way
protecting and supplementing each other. The fortress was
defended by 6,000 men, with 1,000 cannon and ample provisions
of all kinds; in the harbor a division of the Swedish
navy was at anchor. Olof Cronstedt, the commander, was
dissatisfied with the king and a secret supporter of Prince
Charles. His sub-commander, Jægerhorn, a brother of the
leader of the Conspiracy of Anjala, was a traitor, probably
in understanding with the Russians even before the war.
A little army of 4,000 Russians under the command of Van
Suchtelen was sent against Sveaborg. This force was too
small to make a serious attack; it was not able to capture
any of the fortifications; the naked rocks made it impossible
to build any earthworks. What the Russians could not
effect by force they accomplished by treachery, winning
over the commanding officers of Sveaborg through threats
and promises. When the Swedish and Finnish soldiers saw
the queer behavior of their officers they planned a mutiny;
but this was not carried out on account of lack of leadership.
The officers tried by the most shameful lies to pacify
the soldiers, Jægerhorn taking the leading part in these
proceedings. Sveaborg surrendered May 3d, all Swedes
being made prisoners of war, but the Finns given free
leave. When the troops saw the small force of Russians
and their miserable equipment they were enraged, breaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
their weapons and tearing their banners to pieces. Cronstedt,
Jægerhorn and the other commanding officers became
Russian citizens, and received high outward distinctions;
but by both Russians and Finns they were ever treated with
cold contempt on account of their shameless treason.</p>

<p>With the fall of Sveaborg, all hope of saving Finland
was lost. In the summer of 1808, her army fought several
glorious battles under the command of Adlercreutz, Dœbeln
and Sandels, but in the autumn it was attacked by a superior
Russian force and was nearly closed in between Old
Carleby and Vasa. Gripenberg stood with one division at
Old Carleby, furthest to the north, Dœbeln lay prostrated
by illness at New Carleby, and Adlercreutz stood with the
central body of troops at Oravais, about twenty miles south
from the latter town. The Russian army attacked the force
which was with Dœbeln, resolved to cut off Adlercreutz
from a retreat. One attack was already made at Juutas,
near New Carleby, when Dœbeln, alarmed by the news and
heedless of his serious illness, was seen approaching. His
men received him with enthusiasm, collected their scattering
forces and proved victorious over the attacking enemy.
The Russians retreated and Adlercreutz was saved.</p>

<p>The famous battle of Oravais was fought the following
day, September 14th. The Swedish army was arranged
on a promontory in the sea, with artillery on a hill to the
north, close to which a detachment of the regiment of Helsingland
was arranged in an excellent position. Another
detachment of the same regiment was by a little brook at
the south base of the promontory, with two cannon, under
the command of Count William von Schwerin, a boy of sixteen
years. At this latter point the battle was begun at five
o’clock in the morning. The Russians, 8,000 strong, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
twenty cannon and commanded by Kamenski, approached
a bridge leading over the brook. The 400 Swedes offered
a plucky resistance to the overwhelming force. Every time
the bridge was filled by Russians, Schwerin swept it clear
with the fire from his two cannon. This heroic struggle
was kept up for four hours, when the Helsings had no more
cartridges for their guns wherewith to support the artillery
fire. The aide-de-camp Biornstierna, who was despatched
thither by Adlercreutz, saw a pitiable sight. Most of the
officers of the 400 Swedes were killed and the Russians were
storming across the bridge in heavy masses. “Now,
count,” cried Biornstierna, “let us see what your artillery
amounts to!” Schwerin let the Russians approach until
only fifty feet from the cannon, when he ordered: “Fire!”
The whole first fine of the Russian column fell. Schwerin
gave command to have the cannon dragged a hundred
yards back and then fired, with the same disastrous effect.
Thus the retreat was made from hill to hill. At last the
young hero received a mortal wound and his men were
surrounded on every side. With a final effort he rose to
his feet, broke through the lines with his valiant Helsings,
and died in the midst of the Swedish troops.</p>

<p>Adlercreutz closely watched the movements of the Russians,
and saw an opportunity to break through their centre,
which was successfully done, the enemy turning into flight.
It looked like an overwhelming defeat for the Russians,
when reinforcements arrived in the last moment, and the
exhausted Swedes had to stop fighting on account of the
darkness of the night. After a battle of fifteen hours
the Swedes had lost 2,600 men, or nearly one-third of their
forces, but not one single cannon or banner. The remnants
of the army followed the “royal orders of retreat,” crossing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
the Swedish frontier. Finland was lost and Sweden proper
in danger.</p>

<p>Only a revolution could save the country. The republican
aristocrats were the ones to bring it about. A conspiracy
among them was formed, George Adlersparre and
Ch. H. Anckarsverd being the leaders. When it was rumored
that the former, with the western army division,
of which he was the commander, had left the Norwegian
frontier and was marching on Stockholm, Gustavus IV.
sent order to Toll in Scania to meet him with his troops,
while the king seemed to make preparations to leave.
Great excitement reigned in Stockholm, and General Adlercreutz,
who recently had been received in the capital
with enthusiasm, resolved to take action in preventing the
king’s departure. Accompanied by half a dozen officers,
he entered the king’s bedchamber the morning of March
13th, and took possession of the king in person, who made
a struggle and later a frustrated attempt to escape. The
body-guards were persuaded to remain inactive. Prince
Charles was proclaimed regent. Neither this fact nor the
arrest of the king seemed to impress the population, who
received the news with ice-cold reserve. The king was
conducted to Drottningholm, and later to Gripsholm, where
he signed the document of abdication, finally to be escorted
out of the country with his family, never to return. He
died in St. Gallen in 1837.</p>

<p>The regent’s first duty was to ward off the Russian invasion
of Norrland and to obtain peace. Napoleon congratulated
Sweden on having got rid of the “supremacy
of a fool,” and sanctioned an armistice, granted by his
general Marshal Bernadotte, who commanded an army
in Seeland, ready to attack Sweden. Peace was made in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
Paris, Sweden receiving back Pomerania in return for a
promise to close its own harbors against English ships.
Peace with Denmark was made, with no change of territory
on either side. Attempts to rout the Russian army of invasion
at Ratan, in West Bothnia, were unsuccessful, but
it withdrew by its own choice. In the treaty of peace
signed at Fredericshamn, September 17, 1809, Finland, the
archipelago of Aland and a part of Swedish Bothnia were
ceded to Russia, the rivers of Torne and Muonio to form the
boundary line.</p>

<p>Finland, since time immemorial in intimate relations
with Sweden, from whom she had received a portion of her
population, had for 600 years with her mother country
formed integral parts of the same realm. Sweden had
given to Finland her religion, constitution, laws, privileges
and culture, and in return received her fidelity and a host
of patriotic men eminent in affairs of war and peace. Together
the Swedes and Finns had fought on the battlefields
of Europe for the political grandeur of their country and
the religious liberty of the world. United to Russia, Finland
preserved her institutions and privileges unmolested, and
has, up to date, enjoyed a peaceful development greater than
would perhaps have been her share under Swedish rule.
The mother country was after this great loss forced to concentrate
her energy on a more solid material progress, and
has, according to the prophecy of Esaias Tegnér, “within
the boundary of Sweden reconquered Finland.” The Finns
have proved themselves to be one of the most talented and
energetic of nations. Out of the two million inhabitants
of Finland, two-fifths are Swedish, forming the nobility and
the majority of the cultured classes. Already at the time
of the separation from Sweden was born the national singer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
of Finland, John Ludvig Runeberg, who was to become the
greatest poet that ever wrote in the Swedish language and
one of the greatest that ever lived. In his immortal songs
of “Finland’s latest war,” the two countries have a great
common inheritance. Sweden dreamed of reconquering
Finland as soon as a good warrior ascended the throne.
This hope was given up forever. But the most intimate
sympathy still reigns between the two countries. In case
that harm to Finland or her home-rule should be done,
and her independence be lost, the Swedish people would not
be in a position to avenge such a crime, but it would cause
profound grief and indignation, and would be considered
a shameful act of violence which the glory of no peace
emperor would suffice to cover.</p>

<p>By the revolution of 1789, Sweden for a second time
in her history surrendered her liberty into the hands of an
energetic and patriotic ruler only to see the absolute power
utterly abused by an incompetent successor. The loss and
suffering were almost as great as at the death of Charles
XII., but the era of democracy, peace and prosperity so
much closer at hand. It was the spirit of the aristocratic
republicanism which caused the timely downfall of absolute
monarchy, but it was in its turn destined to fall for the
spirit of democracy and a constitutional government.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>The Constitutional Monarchy&mdash;Charles XIII. and the
early Bernadottes</i></span></h2>

<p>Charles XIII. succeeded his nephew. He was
chosen king after a new constitution had been
formulated and accepted by the Riksdag of 1809.
Charles XIII. was one of the most unsympathetic of Swedish
kings, but his reign marks a new period in Swedish
history, commencing the era of constitutional government.
The new constitution to which the king subscribed was not
a radical document; it only reduced the power of the king.
Hans Jærta, one of the nobles who had renounced their
privileges and been active in the conspiracy against Gustavus
IV., was the leading spirit of the constitutional committee
and was appointed secretary of state in the new
cabinet. Urgent appeals of the peasant Estate to reduce
or abolish the privileges of the upper classes were of no
avail, no reform of state or society yet being made. A
proposition by Count von Platen to introduce a compulsory
militia defence was voted down. This Riksdag, which
lasted for a year, gave fuller liberties to the press, which at
once used it to voice the popular dissatisfaction with the
state of affairs. It was necessary to select an heir to the
throne, as the old king was childless, Prince Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
August of Augustenborg being chosen, much in opposition
to the nobles, who wanted the son of Gustavus IV.</p>

<p>The prince of Augustenborg, who was Danish governor-general
of Norway, accepted, and was adopted by the king,
changing his name to Charles August. He was a plain,
resolute and active man, unattractive in appearance, but
of a kind and noble character. Beloved by the lower
classes, who had effected his selection, he was treated coldly
by the Gustavian aristocrats and by Queen Hedvig Elisabeth
Charlotte (Princess of Oldenburg), who all favored the
selection of young Gustavus, the son of exiled Gustavus
IV. Reports of attempts to poison the heir-apparent were
in circulation even before he arrived in Sweden. Prince
Charles August himself often said that he thought he would
die young by some stroke of paralysis, but he paid no attention
to the warnings given him. During a parade of troops
at Qvidinge, in Scania, he was suddenly seen to lose consciousness
and dropped dead from his horse. Peculiarities
in the investigation of the corpse, led by his physician,
caused a second post-mortem examination, in which the
celebrated chemist Berzelius took part. The report seemed
in favor of the supposition that the death was caused by
poison. The indignation of the populace knew no bounds.
The friends of the government tried to coin political money
by insinuating that the Gustavians, particularly Count
Axel von Fersen the Younger and his sister, Countess
Piper, were the responsible parties. At the burial of the
dead prince the mob of Stockholm perpetrated one of the
most hideous murders of a man who was without doubt
innocent. When Count Fersen, in the capacity of marshal
of the realm, was to open the procession, he was warned
not to do so, but in pride and sense of duty resolved to meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
his fate. Approaching the church of Riddarholm, his carriage
was pelted with stones, Fersen himself seeking shelter
in various places, but being pursued by the mob and killed.
Fersen had sought protection in a body of troops, whose
officers commanded them to turn him over to the mob.
Thus perished a man who, with Curt von Stedingk, had
received the order of Cincinnatus from the hands of George
Washington, and who once was so near saving Louis XVI.
and Marie Antoinette from their cruel fate. Fersen’s
brother was saved only by mere chance and his sister by a
flight in disguise. The mob now was resolved to attack
Countess Piper, who was thought to be at the castle, and
the queen herself. But the authorities, who had brought
shame on themselves by their unwillingness to save Fersen,
interfered, directing a few shots of cannon against the mob,
dispersing it and killing many (June 10, 1810).</p>

<p>Sweden was once more without an heir-apparent to the
throne. Frederic, the brother of Charles August, was
favored by the king. Frederic VI. of Denmark was a
candidate, but the old national hatred against the Danes
was still too strong to make his selection possible. A count
of Oldenburg was also mentioned by some. The Gustavians,
to whom Adlercreutz belonged, dared not openly push
their candidate of the old royal line. The patriotic noblemen
in power were anxious to see some great general
chosen, regardless of a royal pedigree, who could recapture
Finland. King Charles sent two emissaries to Napoleon
to notify him of the death of Charles August and the selection
of his brother. Then one of the most original and
daring schemes ever attempted on such a line was carried
through by Count Otto Mœrner, one of the emissaries. On
his own responsibility, he inquired of Marshal Bernadotte,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
one of Napoleon’s ablest generals, if he would consent to
become heir-apparent to the Swedish throne. Bernadotte
consented, and the consent of Napoleon was obtained
through the Swedish ambassador in Paris. Upon his return,
Mœrner was ordered to leave the capital by the minister
of state, who blamed him for his unauthorized action.
But from Upsala Mœrner led an eager agitation, with the
result that the Riksdag of Œrebro selected Bernadotte,
who was represented by a secret emissary. Thus the two
generals who, at the abdication of Gustavus IV., were, one
in Norway, the other in Denmark, with troops ready to
attack Sweden, both within one year were chosen to succeed
Charles XIII.</p>

<p>Jean Baptiste Jules Bernadotte was born at Pau, in
South France, in 1764. The son of a lawyer, he worked
himself up in the army and was by the Revolution enabled
to reach the high military stations for which his eminent
genius had destined him. Next to Napoleon the ablest
of French generals, he opposed the imperial tendencies of
the latter, but was later repeatedly used by the emperor
to fulfil important duties as a warrior, diplomatist and
statesman, receiving the rank of a marshal of France and
the title of Prince of Ponte Corvo. Related by marriage,
the two were never on terms of intimacy, and the Swedish
politicians who thought to please the emperor, and gain
a strong point with him by the selection of Bernadotte, were
mistaken. Bernadotte joined the Lutheran church at Elsinore
and landed in Sweden October 20, 1810. By his impressive
appearance, his amiability and his genius, he soon
won all hearts. As he never acquired the Swedish language,
and as his superior ability as a statesman and warrior
was not always comprehended, he suffered often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
through misunderstandings by his new countrymen, who
never ceased to admire his eminent genius. Prince Charles,
or Charles Johann, as he called himself henceforward, was
of a commanding presence and had an interesting face,
surrounded by black curly hair. His fascinating ways and
winning disposition held captive the admiration even of his
political opponents. Prince Charles refused to submit to
the undue influence with which Napoleon tried to fetter
him, and always carried high and with patriotic independence
the interests of his adopted country.</p>

<p>Napoleon soon found reason to be offended with Sweden.
Through the peace of Paris, Sweden had agreed to close its
harbors to England, but in Gothenburg, which town had
suffered destruction by fire and was recently rebuilt, a lively
traffic was secretly carried on, connecting England with
Northern Europe and enriching Gothenburg. Napoleon
was enraged and forced Sweden to declare war on England,
which power, realizing the circumstances, did not
open any hostilities, and allowed the commercial traffic to
continue, although more secretly. Prince Charles, who
from the start exerted a strong influence upon the government,
effected an approach to Russia and England to save
the dignity of Sweden, much to Napoleon’s dismay. He
also put the army in a satisfactory condition by recruiting.
This caused a revolt in Scania, which was subdued with
severity. The Riksdag of 1812 passed a law for the establishment
of a compulsory militia, all men between twenty-one
and twenty-five years old being registered in classes
according to age and instructed in military tactics and
discipline.</p>

<p>Napoleon tried by various methods to subdue and humiliate
the independence of his Swedish ally, which, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
fruitless, led him to acts of hostility. Prince Charles made
peace with England and an alliance with Russia, who
promised 20,000 men to assist in the conquest of Norway.
When Napoleon and Alexander of Russia commenced war
against each other, popular opinion in Sweden sided with
the former, but Prince Charles, who knew in detail the
nature of Napoleon’s power and its lack of a solid foundation,
tried to make his views clear. He met Alexander
personally, agreeing with him on plans of mutual action, at
Abo in 1812. After Napoleon’s unsuccessful march against
Russia, Swedish opinions changed and Bernadotte had free
hands to follow up his policy. England formed an alliance
with Sweden, agreeing to support the conquest of Norway
and ceding the island of Guadeloupe (later sold to France
by Sweden). In 1813, 25,000 Swedish troops were sent
to Germany, joining the continental allies, who, divided
in three armies, were to attack Napoleon, according to
plans mostly mapped out by Prince Charles of Sweden.
The latter was to command the Northern army of 100,000
men, Swedes, Prussians, Russians and English, but his
position was a difficult one, for his superior tactics were
misunderstood by his subordinates and by Blucher, the
valiant but headstrong commander of 50,000 Prussians,
who formed the Silesian army. But through the battles
of Grossbeeren (August 23d), Dennewitz (September 6th),
and Leipsic (October 16-19), the eminence of Bernadotte’s
genius was fully brought out, his leadership and the Swedish
troops taking honorable part in each. Napoleon and his
armies were defeated and pursued by the allies. The monarchs
voted a resolution of thanks to Prince Charles, who,
with his army, marched northward to carry out the ultimate
object of his policy, the conquest of Norway, the plans of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
which had been made by Count Platen and handed him
before he ever left Paris.</p>

<p>Denmark had declared war on Sweden and sided with
Napoleon. By turning against Denmark the former Marshal
Bernadotte saved himself from the necessity of making
an attack on the country of his birth. Lubeck surrendered,
the Danes were defeated at Bornhœved, Kiel and Glucksburg
were captured, and the whole of Holstein occupied. An
armistice was agreed to. Denmark offered the diocese of
Drontheim, but Prince Charles was resolved to expel Denmark
from the Scandinavian Peninsula. January 14, 1814,
peace was made at Kiel, Denmark ceding to Sweden the
whole of Norway, except Iceland and Fero Islands, and
receiving Swedish Pomerania and the island of Rugen in
compensation.</p>

<p>Norway, united with Denmark ever since the days of
Queen Margaret, in a relation of more or less neglected
conditions, during which her original independence was
lost, had of late not been satisfied to remain under Danish
supremacy. The governing class of officeholders was to
a great extent of Danish origin and tendencies, and the
patriotism of the population at large dates from a later
period. Among the more cultured classes the revolution in
France and close relations with England had fostered a
desire for political independence. The Danes made use
of this fact in order to try to maintain the relation with
Denmark in some way. The Danish crown prince, Christian
Frederic, was in 1813 made governor-general of Norway.
He was a man of some brilliant gifts, but without
any great ability. By journeys in the country he acquired
popularity and adherents. In February, 1814, a
meeting was held at Eidsvold by men of prominence, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
declared the prince regent. May 17th a constitution was
adopted and Christian Frederic elected king of Norway.
His courteous offer of extending his rule to Sweden was
there met by derision. After a triumphal return to Stockholm,
Prince Bernadotte gathered his forces and attacked
Norway both by land and sea, the aged King Charles XIII.
having command of the navy. An army of 20,000 Swedes
entered Norway under command of Von Essen, who captured
the fortifications at Svinesund. The navy took possession
of the islands in the archipelago outside of Fredericstad,
which town was captured, with the fortress Kongsten,
100 cannon and considerable stores of weapons and provisions.
The Norwegian army of 30,000 men was located in
various places with the central body of troops at Moss.
The plan of Prince Charles was to enclose it from all sides.
A smaller Swedish force of 3,000 men was repulsed by the
Norwegians in two conflicts at Lier and Medskog, celebrated
by the latter as important victories. In the meantime
the Swedish army proceeded northward and the fleet
penetrated to the bay of Christiania. The plan to enclose
the Norwegian army at Moss was being carried into effect
in order to finish the war by one single battle, when negotiations
for peace were begun.</p>

<p>Prince Charles was anxious to have the conflict brought
to a rapid close because he feared that the powers, envious
of Sweden’s good fortune and dissatisfied with the refusal
of Prince Charles to join in an attack on France, might
take unfavorable decisions at the approaching congress of
Vienna. Prompted by these reasons, and perhaps influenced
by his experience of revolutionary movements, Prince
Charles offered to sanction Norway’s constitution only with
such changes as were necessary for a union with Sweden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
besides demanding the abdication and speedy departure
of Christian Frederic. On these terms peace was made at
the convention of Moss, August 14, 1814. At the first
meeting of the Norwegian Storthing, or Diet, the terms of
peace were sanctioned and Charles XIII. chosen king
of Norway. At the Congress of Vienna, in 1815, treaties
were signed between Sweden and Prussia and between Denmark
and Prussia, according to which Swedish Pomerania
and Rugen were ceded to Prussia on the payment of about
$2,000,000, and the duchy of Lauenburg ceded to Denmark.
In the relation between Sweden and Norway no change was
made, and Denmark lost all hope of the restitution of the
latter country.</p>

<p>The great moderation shown by Prince Charles in the
acquisition of Norway has been criticised in various ways,
but none of the arguments used against it have themselves
been able to bear a critical test. The idea of uniting
the two countries as independent states was older in Sweden
than the very constitution of Norway which Prince Charles
accepted. It was the idea of the leading men in Sweden
who had dethroned Gustavus IV. in 1809. The Scandinavian
Union is not the best imaginable, has brought Sweden
no added power or security, and has placed her king in
a difficult position. The only bond of union is the king,
the two countries each having their constitution, diet and
cabinet. There is only one department in common, the one
of which the Swedish minister of foreign affairs is the head
and which settles all relations with other countries for both
Sweden and Norway. Three members of the Norwegian
cabinet are residents of Stockholm, to prepare affairs pertaining
to the Norwegian administration and to partake in
affairs involving both countries. These stipulations are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
made by the Act of Union, accepted in 1815 by the Diets
of both countries. According to the Norwegian constitution,
the king can use no greater force than 3,000 men outside
the Norwegian boundary, except with the special consent
of the Diet. Thus Sweden cannot in case of war expect
any solid support from her sister country. The loose connections
of the Union did not become apparent during the
reigns of Charles XIII. and his successor, and the powers
of Europe were not aware of them. Thus the Union served
its purpose as offering a solid front of unity and strength
to the powers who were dividing and redividing almost
every territory on the map of Europe.</p>

<p>Charles XIII. died in February, 1818, at the age of
seventy, and his talented queen followed him a few months
later.</p>

<p><i>Charles XIV. Johann</i> was fifty-four years of age when
ascending the throne, but a man in his prime. To the
dignity of the crown he brought a great personal influence,
and his fame as a warrior, which spread throughout
Europe. The firm diplomatic relations with Russia were
continued, but approaches to England were also made.
Charles XIV. gave close personal attention to the administration,
being especially interested in the defence, finances,
canals and roads. With his brilliant genius, quick temper
and sense of superiority, the king sometimes reigned more
alone and by his own decision than was considered advisable;
but in the majority of cases he was influenced by the
able men of his cabinet&mdash;Wetterstedt, Rosenblad, Skjœldebrand,
Cederstrom and Wirsén. An intimate friend of the
king was Count Magnus Brahe, who, though not a member
of the cabinet, influenced the government more than was
thought compatible with its dignity. Count Brahe, the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
of one of the most distinguished of aristocratic families, used
his great influence over the king mostly in a noble way, himself
being raised to the highest dignities of the state. He
was blindly devoted to the king, followed him like a shadow,
taking infinite care of him during his last illness, and dying
only a few months after his royal friend.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable works carried on during the
reign of Charles XIV. was the Gotha Canal system, which
was brought to completion. The old bishop Brask had
spoken of a connection between the lakes of Venar and Vetter,
and the great Oxenstierna thought of a canal between
the North Sea and the Baltic across Sweden. Charles XII.
had ordered Polhem to make a trafficable passage around
the waterfalls of Trollhetta, which was done after new plans
during the reign of Gustavus IV. During the Period of
Liberty, Daniel Thunberg had made plans for the whole
canal system. But Count Balzar von Platen was the man
to make the great work a realized fact, devoting his whole
life to it, conquering distrust, opposition and lack of funds.
He spent six years in preliminary surveys before taking up
the agitation for the realization of his plans. During the
whole progress of the work, his efficient activity in looking
after every detail could only be compared to his constant
agitation in the Riksdag for the support of the immense
enterprise and his scrupulous attention to the financial part
of it. When the great canal was opposed as an unpatriotic
scheme, endangering the defence of the country, Platen
answered by completing plans for a colossal fortress in the
heart of the canal system, which, when erected, became
the strategic stronghold of Sweden, and was named Carlsborg.
Platen died as governor-general of Norway, seeing
his great life-work nearing completion. The Gotha Canal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
is the most remarkable of its kind in Europe, being 259
miles long, with 74 locks, many of which have been cut out
of solid granite hills. It is of great value to commerce and
affords a most picturesque scenic tour.</p>

<p>Charles XIV. met with a power in politics which, from
the start not strong enough to carry away victory, ended
by attaining its goal. It was the liberal opposition in the
Riksdag, supported by a liberal press. Charles XIV., in
his native country, had seen to what an infamy the abuse
of liberal forms of government could lead, and he was
sternly resolved to antagonize any movement which aimed
to introduce more democratic principles in the handling
of state affairs and in the remodelling of the system of
representation. Charles XIV. was in a delicate personal
position. He was the only one of the Napoleonic marshals
who preserved his throne after the fall of the emperor, and
the strong continental reaction looked askance at this new
man who wore one of the oldest crowns of Europe. But
his great reputation as a warrior and statesman, and his
persistent peace policy, ought to have been to him sufficient
guarantees of the fidelity of his subjects. Charles XIV.,
in the agitation against the self-willed cabinet, saw an
enmity against himself. By a network of secret detectives,
the king tried to uncover conspiracies and plots which
existed in his imagination only, or in that of those who were
aware of his weakness and sought to gain personal favors
by making use of it. The severity with which the press
was censured and its members punished created a bitterness
against the king personally, which ceased only during
the few last years of his reign. With the new constitution
a law establishing full liberty of public utterance in print
was enacted, but a temporary restraint had been placed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
this liberty, in 1812, on account of violent newspaper attacks
upon Russia. The government still made use of this
restraint, which caused many severe legal sentences and
subsequent bitterness.</p>

<p>Among the press organs of that period the “Argus” and
“Aftonbladet” were the most conspicuous in their attacks
upon the conservative government; Lars Hierta, one of the
ablest of Swedish editorial writers, was the publisher of the
latter. His paper was repeatedly confiscated. Anders
Lindeberg was the publisher of “Stockholmsposten.” In
an agitation against the royal monopoly in theatrical affairs,
Lindeberg threw out the accusation that the king, for
purely economical reasons, opposed a reform in those matters.
He was arraigned and a sentence of death passed
upon him, which was commuted to three years’ imprisonment.
But Lindeberg refused to accept any clemency,
declaring himself ready and resolved to die. The government,
who dared not take his life, was in a delicate predicament,
but saved itself and Lindeberg by announcing pardon
of “political criminals,” at the anniversary of the king’s first
arrival in Sweden. Jacob Crusenstolpe, a novelist and
writer of note, was one of the intimate friends and supporters
of the government, but turned liberal, attacking the
king in a pamphlet. He was sentenced to three years’
imprisonment, which created great commotion and a revolt
in Stockholm, not subdued except after a bloody conflict
with the troops (July, 1838). Crusenstolpe continued
writing from his prison.</p>

<p>The principal leaders of the opposition in the Riksdag
were L. Boye, F. B. von Schwerin and C. H. Anckarsverd
among the nobles, and Anders Danielsson among the peasants.
This opposition criticised the government for negli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>gence,
extravagance and incompetency. Its policy was an
entire reconstruction of the state, politically, socially and
financially, on the basis of a constitutional government.
The opposition commenced by establishing the right of free
deliberations in the Riksdag. At the Riksdags of 1827 and
1828 the government was severely taken to task on account
of the sale of ships to the Spanish insurgents in South
America. The king was inclined to join England against
Spain, but had to recede on account of pressure from Russia
and the continental powers. The sales were partly annulled
and the Swedish government experienced a considerable
financial loss. Cederstrom was the responsible party, but
upon his resignation his able successor Wirsén was able
to cover up his tracks.</p>

<p>If Sweden was forced to change her policy in the South
American affair she was found unyielding in the settlement
of the boundary questions with Russia. This power was
anxious to obtain a slice of the Norwegian Finnmark, with
excellent ice-free harbors at the bay of Varanger. In the
ultimate settlement with Russia, in 1826, a great territory
was ceded, but not any of the important harbors.</p>

<p>In 1840 the opposition had waxed strong enough to effect
one of its most desired reforms, the constitutional reconstruction
of the cabinet. This body was made to consist
of ten members, of whom seven were to be the heads of the
various state departments, those of justice, foreign affairs,
army, navy, civil service, finance and ecclesiastics.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> As
a consequence of this change in the constitution, several
cabinet members resigned and were succeeded by men more
in touch with the opposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span></p>

<p>The greatest of contemplated reforms was a new system
of representation, but the opposition was not able to carry
it through. At the first revolution of Gustavus III., Stedingk
favored a reconstruction of the Riksdag after the
model of the English parliament. Gustavus III, was afraid
to cause complications by the introduction of such a novelty,
but considered it gravely at the time of his second
revolution. In 1830, the idea was taken up by the opposition,
and Anckarsverd and the eminent lawyer Richert made
up a plan for a new Diet, according to the plan of the Norwegian
Storthing. This plan, with the idea of one chamber,
instead of two, was repeatedly discussed at the Riksdag
of 1840, but not adopted. This remarkable Riksdag,
which lasted seventeen months, did considerable for the
improvement of education and was ultimately dismissed
by Charles XIV., in a speech of a conciliatory spirit,
which went far toward restoring the old popularity of
the king.</p>

<p>Charles XIV. died March 8, 1844, at the age of eighty-one.
During the last years of his reign he received strong
and repeated evidence of the love of his people, especially
upon the occasion of his twenty-fifth anniversary as king
of Sweden. “No one has made a career like mine,” he said
shortly before his death. He was a child of the revolutionary
epoch, favored by its opportunities to receive a high
station, without being sullied by any of its vices. If it be
true that his position often was made difficult through lack
of appreciation by his new subjects, it is not less true that
he, through lack of intimacy with the Swedish language,
national character and traditions, was unable to further the
development of his new country, in the same degree as
would a native provided with such rich endowment. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
sun of Charles XIV., which rose in brilliancy, set in the
glory of full appreciation.</p>

<p>The reign of Charles XIV. produced a new line of eminent
scientists and was the golden age of Swedish literature.
The remarkable genius of J. J. Berzelius remolded
the science of chemistry, placing it on a basis where there
are hardly any limits to its scope. Elias Fries devised a
new system of botany. Sven Nilsson, a distinguished zoölogist,
also became the founder of a new science, comparative
archæology. K. J. Schlyter edited a complete collection
of the old provincial laws, a work of equal importance
to philology and jurisprudence. P. H. Ling invented the
Swedish system of gymnastics and founded the Central
Institute of Gymnastics in Stockholm, where the Swedish
massage or movement cure has won a scientific development
worthy of its world-wide fame. E. G. Geijer,
as a philosopher, was a noble follower of Hœijer, while as
a historian he is the greatest genius of his country. As a
poet and composer Geijer is also noteworthy. Professor
of history at Upsala, he was once accused of heterodoxy,
but acquitted. His political career was remarkable. Geijer
was a firm supporter of the government and conservative
principles, until fifty-seven years of age, when he joined the
opposition.</p>

<p>The world of letters was divided in parties as bitterly
opposed to each other as those of the political world. The
old Gustavian school, of which Leopold remained the last
representative, was attacked by the “New School,” which,
inspired by German Romanticism, was brimful of inspiration,
imagination and feelings, but very little that was original,
clear or national. Of this so-called “phosphoristic”
school Atterbom was the distinguished leader. Stagnelius, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
poet of rare attainments, but who died early, belongs in this
group. The New School was in turn attacked by the “Gothic
Society,” a school of national Swedish Romanticism, which
introduced a cult of the Old Northern spirit of individuality,
terseness and power. Ling and Geijer were among the
leading men of this school, whose enthusiasm for everything
national had a lasting influence upon the research for, and
gathering of, folk lore, songs, traditions, customs, and every
trait of the popular culture of bygone days. In Franzén
and Wallin, Sweden had two religious poets of the very
first rank. More famous than any of these was Esaias
Tegnér, the second great national poet of Sweden, whose
“Frithiof’s Saga” was destined to become the most celebrated
literary work of all Europe in its day, appearing in
a vast number of translations in a great number of languages.
Tegnér was in sympathy with the old Gustavian
school, but a member of the Gothic Society, and by his
choice of subjects in harmony with the national school.
There is a wonderful richness of sparkling life and wit in
Tegnér’s poems, but they are sometimes overladen by the
vivid ornamental images in which they abound. Tegnér
was a man of extremely broad and liberal views on every
phase of human life and effort. He hated with the whole
power of his fiery soul the mysticism, obscurantism and
morbid sensualism of his age. He was the sworn enemy
of the “Holy Alliance” and the reactionary powers in state,
church and literature. In his chivalrous spirit and love of
the great individuals, he became the admirer of Charles
XIV., whose policy he therefore supported. Tegnér is not
the one who in the grandeur and faultlessness of his creations
has attained the very highest rank among Swedish
poets, but is the greatest and most unbiased thinker among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
them, and has as such exerted a beneficial influence upon
the national consciousness and cultural development. Tegnér’s
judgment upon one of his Gustavian precursors may
be repeated in his own case: “Perchance the greatest not
as poet, but as genius.”</p>

<p><i>Oscar I.</i> was forty-five years of age at the death of his
father. He was the only son of Charles XIV. and Queen
Desideria, the latter a daughter of a French merchant by
the name of Clary. Oscar was, in 1823, married to Princess
Josephine of Leuchtenberg, a granddaughter of the
French empress of the same name. It was a difficult position,
the one held by the heir-apparent. Charles XIV. was
jealous of his own power and popularity and suspected his
son of being in sympathy with the opposition. The prince,
distanced as far as possible from the affairs of state, devoted
himself to the study of social and economic subjects. He
gave a great deal of attention to the study of prisons and
the care of prisoners, seeking by pamphlets to spread his
sympathies for the latter and to improve their conditions.
Oscar I. was fondly devoted to the fine arts, himself a
talented painter and composer. He did not possess his
father’s brilliant genius or power of personal influence,
although an upright man of great talent and exceedingly
prepossessing in appearance. Oscar was of a mild, sagacious
disposition, who liked to go into detail and take
time for investigation and decision. He was not a man
of action, and lacked somewhat consistency in carrying
out plans of a wider scope. Oscar I. had a little of the
autocrat of the father in him and often acted on his own
judgment, without taking the advice of his cabinet. Being
the loyal, highly cultured and patriotic man that he was,
he in various ways furthered the development of his country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span></p>

<p>Few kings have ascended a throne under such enthusiasm
and joyful aspirations on the part of the people as
King Oscar I. Several important reforms were enacted
at the Riksdag which met in 1844, and the king gave his
sanction to them all. It was decided that the Riksdag
should meet every third instead of every fifth year, the liberty
of the press was augmented, and to women were given
equal rights in the stipulations of inheritance and marriage.
The last-mentioned reform was bitterly opposed by the
nobles, who feared it would, to a great extent, annul their
privileges. The law was passed by the three lower Estates,
in spite of the nobles, and was sanctioned by the king.
Oscar I. took great pains to have the industries freed from
the restraint under which they had been suffering during
the reign of his predecessor.</p>

<p>King Oscar surrounded himself with men of a more
modern type than his father’s advisers. They were in
touch with the principles of the opposition, although far
from radical, and more respected for their character than
for their ability. The opposition, which had been so harsh
during the administration of Charles XIV., was toned
down considerably; but complaints were soon heard that
the new government was neither consistent nor resolute
in its liberal policy and that courtiers and young officers
won an unduly rapid promotion. Soon an opposition of a
new order was organized against the administration. The
conservatives, finding that it leaned too much on the liberal
principles, attacked it for this reason. A powerful
conservative party at the Riksdag was organized, with
Hartmansdorff as the leader among the nobles and Archbishop
Wingard among the clergy. Attacked by liberals
and conservatives alike, and not supported by either,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
the government was of an undecided and vacillating
tenor.</p>

<p>The French revolution of 1848 influenced Swedish politics
in several ways. The “friends of reform,” viz., the
party desiring a parliamentary reorganization, were incited
by the republican tendencies. The masses of Stockholm
on one occasion gave vent to their feelings by demonstrations
which were of a menacing character. Great crowds
collected outside the place where a “reform banquet” was
held. There it was resolved to attack the houses of Hartmansdorff
and several other leading conservatives. The
owners placed themselves in safety, but the windows of the
houses were broken by the mob, who also threw stones at
the troops. The tumult was quenched, but not without
bloodshed. The press was greatly agitated for a long time
afterward, using language against the government that was
by no means choice. The liberals in the Riksdag commenced
to take an attitude as decided as the one held by
the conservatives. From this time on King Oscar showed
great coldness to the liberals, and surrounded himself with
advisers more in harmony with the conservatives.</p>

<p>The proposition for a reorganization of the Riksdag, made
in 1840, was not accepted, but a committee was appointed
in 1848 to make a new proposition, which failed to please
either government or Riksdag. The king then had a
new proposition prepared, based upon general elections.
The liberals did not think the royal proposition democratic
enough and offered one of their own. Both of these were
defeated at the Riksdag of 1850, thanks to the opposition
of nobility and clergy. A third one was made by Hartmansdorff,
but also failed to please, not being conservative
enough for the nobles. Hartmansdorff aroused so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
hatred among his fellow nobles that they refused to be
seated on the same bench with him during the sessions.
After a period of perfect isolation the old conservative leader
was judged with greater leniency by his former followers.
Shortly before his death, in 1856, he sent them the following
greeting: “Ask the nobles not to stand up so long for their
privileges, they will lose nothing by surrendering them.”
It seemed as if the interest for parliamentary reform had
died out during the latter part of King Oscar’s reign, but
such was not the case; it only gathered force in the quiet,
and the king was right when defining it as a “question
which could never fall.”</p>

<p>The influence of the revolution of 1848 also was felt in
the foreign relations of Sweden. The German population of
Holstein and Schleswig tried to sever their connections with
Denmark in order to effect a union with Germany, Prussia
taking upon herself to liberate said provinces. Denmark
made various efforts to gain the active support of Sweden.
The so-called “Scandinavism” was a good means to obtain
this end. This movement, which aimed at the establishment
of a closer union between the three Scandinavian countries,
based upon the fact of the common origin of their inhabitants,
had originated at the University of Copenhagen. The
meetings of scientists and students, in 1842 and 1843, at
Stockholm, had given growth to this movement, which was
of a very high-strung nature, but, as far as the Danes were
concerned, also of an egotistical motive. Charles XIV. had
been averse to this “students’ policy,” but Oscar I. was
sympathetically impressed by it. “Scandinavism” rose
high in 1848, especially at the universities, and King Oscar
sent a communication to the Prussian government to the
effect that he was resolved to oppose any attack on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
Danish isles. An army of 20,000 men was ordered to
Scania to give weight to this statement. A smaller division
of it was even for a time quartered in the island of Funen.
The German troops which had invaded Jutland soon retired
and hostilities ceased for some time. King Oscar effected
an armistice of seven months in August, 1848. As a result
of the war between Denmark and Germany during the next
few years an agreement followed, according to which Holstein
and Schleswig would for some time remain under
Danish supremacy.</p>

<p>King Oscar had, from the commencement of his reign,
tried to meet all demands for reform made by his Norwegian
subjects, who were anxious to demonstrate to the
world the perfect independence of their country. The king
himself took the initiative steps to give Norway a national
flag of its own, the two countries up to the reign of Oscar
having had one common official flag. He also instituted the
Norwegian knightly order of St. Olaf in resemblance to
the older Swedish orders of Seraphim, Vasa, etc., and gave
permission to place the name of Norway before that of Sweden
in the Norwegian royal title. For these reasons public
opinion in Sweden expected Norwegian concessions in regard
to the Act of Union, which seemed in need of revision.
A committee of men from both countries was appointed to
make the revision, but the Norwegian members opposed all
measures involving any change, expressing themselves in
such emphatic terms that it was found best to leave the
deliberations of the committee unpublished. In 1854 the
Norwegian Storthing decided to abolish the office of a governor-general.
King Oscar refused to sanction this law,
but allowed the office to remain vacant during the rest of
his reign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span></p>

<p>Intemperance had grown to be an evil from which the
Swedish people greatly suffered since the reign of Gustavus
III., when alcohol began to be produced in great quantities
by the common people. The king encouraged the temperance
movement, which was very fruitful in results. In 1853
the Riksdag abolished the free and unrestrained production
of alcohol, which was changed into a regular industry and
placed under heavy taxation. From 1855 onward, the principles
of free trade were adopted for commerce and trade
through the influence of J. A. Gripenstedt, the minister of
finance, and seemed to have beneficial results in every
branch of industrial and commercial activity. The state
revenues were greatly increased and the surplus spent in
improvements of the widest scope. The means of interior
communications were vastly improved. In 1853 the network
of the state electric telegraph began to spread and
now embraces every part of the country. The agitation
for the construction of railways had long been an active
one. The first one constructed was a private railway between
Œrebro and Arboga. In 1854 the Riksdag decided
on the construction of trunk lines in Southern Sweden, to be
built and controlled by the state. The Riksdag of 1856
appropriated a sum of $5,000,000 for that purpose. The
railways were rapidly and solidly built under the supervision
of Baron Nils Ericsson, the highly talented brother of
John Ericsson, the world-famous inventor of the propeller,
the caloric engine, the steam hose and the “Monitor.”</p>

<p>The relations with Russia were not the best during the
latter part of King Oscar’s reign. The Russian claims on
the harbors at the bay of Varanger were repeated in 1847,
and when deliberations for a settlement were opened, in
1851, Russia showed a tendency to take possession of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
desired places. In the conflict between Russia, on one hand,
and Turkey, supported by England and France, on the
other, Sweden sided with the latter, especially after Russia
had failed to recognize an alliance of neutrality under arms
formed by Sweden-Norway and Denmark. In 1855 Sweden
entered an agreement with France, promising not to cede
any territory to Russia in case of a conflict. In 1856 peace
was made at Paris; the only favor won by Sweden was
a pledge made by Russia not to fortify the archipelago of
Aland.</p>

<p>King Oscar was a very hard worker and also fond of the
pleasures of life. His health was injured through illness,
in 1857, and he never recovered. The premature death of
his second son, Prince Gustavus, a talented composer and
highly popular, had a disastrous influence on him. King
Oscar I. died July 8, 1859, after a long illness, beloved by
the two nations who, during his reign, had enjoyed the
happiest epoch of their history.</p>

<p>Romanticism in literature had an important second blossom
during the reign of King Oscar I. and his successor.
With the exception of Runeberg and Almquist, it offers no
name of the very first rank. But Runeberg, the Homer
of the North, does not belong to Sweden alone, and Almquist,
the only great Romanticist, had made his appearance
during the preceding epoch. Charles John Ludvig Almquist
was a genius of great versatility and exceptional endowment.
He wrote with equal force in all branches of
literature; besides the poet, dramatist and prosaist, being
a good philologist and well versed in a number of practical
pursuits. He anticipated the ideas of which George Sand
became a champion, and wrote charming peasant idyls long
before Auerbach and Bjœrnson. His most important work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
is an ambiguous creation, conceived somewhat in the form
of Boccaccio’s “Decamerone,” but much larger, and containing
productions in every imaginable artistic form. It is
called <i>Tœrnrosens bok</i> (The Book of the Wild Rose).
Almquist has not, like Bellman and Tegnér, crystallized
the Swedish national character in a lyrical form, but he
remains, in spite of glaring defects, the most versatile and
supremely gifted genius of Swedish literature.</p>

<p>Nybom, Bœttiger, Malmstrœm, Sætherberg and Strandberg
were talented lyric poets of this epoch, Von Braun,
Sturzen-Becker and Sehlstedt good humorists, while Bœrjesson,
Blanche, Jolin, Dahlgren and Frans Hedberg wrote
successfully for the stage. Swedish women were destined
to win fame for themselves by bringing the novelistic form
to a richer development; principal among whom were Frederica
Bremer, Sophie von Knorring, Emilie Carlén and
Sophie Schwartz, while the men Crusenstolpe, Sparre, Mellin,
Ridderstad and Starbæck cultivated the field of historical
fiction, for which Swedish history offers such a
wealth of appropriate subjects.</p>

<p>Swedish composers of note were becoming numerous,
although the field in which they chiefly excel is the
rather limited one of lyric song, the most spontaneous
medium of expression for the lyrico-rhetoric Swedish temperament.
As the composer of “lieder” or <i>visor</i>, Adolphus
Lindblad, an intimate friend of Mendelssohn, occupies a
revered place in the history of music. Close to him stand
Crusell, Nordblom and Josephsson, while Hæffner, Otto
Lindblad, one of the noblest composers in this line, Prince
Gustavus and Vennerberg are famous principally for their
part songs.</p>

<p>The cultivators of dramatic and orchestral composition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
have as yet been comparatively few. Chief among them
is Bervald; further, Norman and Hallstrœm. In a later
contemporary epoch, Hallén, Aulin, Sjœgren, Stenhammar
have considerably brightened this aspect of cultural development.
Gunnar Vennerberg occupies an honored place as
a poet, humorist and composer in one. There seems to be a
deeply rooted tendency in the Swedish national temperament
to unite the various branches of artistic creation, which
would stamp it as romantic in its very essence if there did
not run a vein of stunningly realistic portrayals through the
works of such composite nature. In the art of Bellman this
tendency has found its highest exponent. Bellman selected
for his subjects the life of the lower middle classes in the
Swedish capital of his day. His Fredman sings of the experiences
of himself and his friends. Vennerberg has
chosen the student’s life at the University of Upsala as the
subject of his duets between two students, “Gluntarne,” in
which are mirrored as faithfully, and sometimes as artistically,
as by Bellman the humorous and pathetic scenes which
have fascinated the poet and composer.</p>

<p>Swedish song for the first time acquired universal fame
through Jenny Lind, who has had many successors, but no
peer as a dramatic singer. Contemporaneous with Jenny
Lind were a number of highly talented histrionic artists,
principal among whom were Lars Hjortsberg, Nils William
Almlœf, Olof Ulric Torsslov, Emilie Hœgquist and Carl
Georg Dahlquist. The Swedish stage has set a good example
for the preservation of the highest standards of the
language, and in this line exerted a great cultural influence.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Parliamentary Reform&mdash;Charles XV</i></span></h2>

<p>Charles XV., the eldest son of Oscar I., succeeded
his father, having for two years presided
over the government during king Oscar’s last illness.
King Charles was of gigantic stature, exceedingly
handsome and of a manly and noble bearing. There dwelt
a fiery soul within him, conscious of its power, longing for
heroic deeds and in sympathy with all that was noble in life
and art. The king possessed an abundance of youthful
energy and vivacity. He was a passionate hunter and a
gay companion, who surrounded himself with men equally
boisterous and gay. He was fond of jokes and merry pastimes,
and took no pains to hide his weaknesses, which were
of a convivial nature. In his social intercourse the king
was exceptionally open and frank, treating everybody alike
in a good-natured, hearty manner, winning the whole heart
of his people. He understood better than any king since
Charles XI. how to put himself in cordial relation with the
masses of the people. But fond of playing practical jokes
on high and low, he did not like to receive in the
same measure. Charles XV. was devoted to the pursuits
of art. Especially in his youth, he wrote poetry and distinguished
himself as a landscape painter through his love
for typical Swedish sceneries. Sweden did not at first know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
what to expect of her new ruler, and no one was able to predict
the course of his policy. There were fears that his
youthfulness and his fiery southern temperament might lead
him to feel satisfied with the exterior of things or that he
might give way to the impulses of the moment. These
fears soon proved to be without foundation. The king had
chosen as his maxim “Land shall with law be built,” from
the old provincial law of Upland, and he remained, with
very rare exceptions, true to the constitutional spirit of
these words. He had the good fortune to find highly
capable advisers, in whose hands he placed the details
of the administration, and, in contrast to his father, was
satisfied to give his attention exclusively to matters of a
more general importance. He gave his unreserved support
to his cabinet, occupying a position above all party interests.
Charles XV. often sacrificed, sometimes only after considerable
internal struggle, his own personal sympathies and
inclinations at the request of the advisers when he saw that
the welfare of his country and his own royal dignity demanded
such a sacrifice. On account of this, his true constitutional
spirit, he deserved as a ruler the blind adoration
of his people. His summer residence, the castle of Ulricsdal,
in the neighborhood of Stockholm, he changed into
an artistic abode, with choice collections in various lines.
Charles XV. had, in 1850, married Princess Louise of the
Netherlands, of the royal house of Orange. Their daughter,
Louise, was married to the crown prince of Denmark,
and is still in life, while King Charles had to suffer the
premature losses of his only son and of his consort.</p>

<p>The cabinet which surrounded Charles XV. was one
of the strongest bodies of its kind that ever controlled the
government of Sweden. During his regency, Crown Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
Charles appointed Baron Louis de Geer minister of justice
and Ludvig Manderstrœm minister of foreign affairs. These
men continued their duties during the reign of Charles XV.,
while Gripenstedt, as minister of finance, followed up his
beneficent activity for the emancipation and development of
the national industries. The historian, Frederic Ferdinand
Carlson, had been the teacher of King Charles and had
successfully continued the monumental work of Swedish
history, left unfinished by Geijer. Carlson occupied, during
the greater part of the reign of Charles XV., the position
of minister of ecclesiastics (church and education), in
which capacity he did great work for the improvement
of educational affairs. The high schools and colleges were
reorganized through new regulations of 1859, being the
work of Carlson before his appointment to the cabinet.
Carlson also improved the public, or common, schools.
King Charles was a warm friend of public instruction. In
one of his speeches from the throne he said: “This is my
ambition that a true and living culture shall penetrate our
people and with its blessings reach the humblest of its
cottages.”</p>

<p>The relations between Sweden and Norway, during the
first few years of the reign of Charles XV., were strained.
The Norwegian Storthing once more voted the abolition of
the office of a governor-general. It was thought that the
king, who earlier, as viceroy of Norway, had spoken in a
spirit of acquiescence upon this question, would sanction the
vote of the Storthing. But in Sweden great indignation was
felt. It was known and understood that the Act of Union
contained nothing in regard to the office in question, but
was created by a stipulation in the constitution of Norway
which admitted the possibility of its being filled by a Swede.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
The Norwegian view was that the Storthing had exclusive
right to decide the question, while the Swedish view was
that it was a question concerning the Union and to be decided
on by the diets of the two countries. Practically the
Swedes were right; theoretically, and from a purely patriotic
standpoint, which considered necessary the development
of a perfect national independence even at the expense
of the Union, the Norwegians were right. Ankarsverd,
well known since the days of Charles XIV., made a motion,
at the Swedish Riksdag of 1859, for the revision of the Act
of Union on the basis of the treaty of Kiel, which motion
in Norway was accepted as an insult. V. F. Dalman made
a motion that the Estates should ask the king not to render
a decision in the question of a Norwegian governor-general
before the Riksdag had had an opportunity to look into the
international aspect of the question. Great was the commotion
caused by this issue, both in the diets and the press
of the two countries. Swedish pamphlets were circulated
which accepted the possibility of a dissolution of the Union.
But in Norway, where the security of a union with Sweden
had become apparent, especially during the conflict with
Russia, such utterances were repudiated. Both of the motions
in question were passed by the four Estates of the
Riksdag, but put in such a shape that a request to have
a revision of the Act of Union made was sent up to the king,
with the demand for a royal proposition on that issue. The
king was then asked to consider the question of a Norwegian
governor-general in connection with that revision. As
there was a difference of opinion also in the cabinets of the
two countries, the final decision rested with the king alone.
The sagacity and discernment of which King Charles gave
evidence saved the situation and is worthy of praise. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
declared in the Norwegian cabinet that he could not sanction
the abolition of the office of a governor-general.
Shortly afterward, he gave in the Swedish cabinet as his
opinion the advisability of postponing, for the time being,
all deliberations of a revision of the Act of Union. By
doing so, the king quieted the high feelings in both countries,
and peace returned. It had become apparent to both
Swedes and Norwegians that the Union was the result of
great political foresight because it was preserved through
the increasing feeling of faith and of the necessity of mutual
protection. That great obscurity existed in regard to
the affairs regulating the Union had also become evident.</p>

<p>The reforms and improvements which were effected
during the reign of Charles XV. were highly important.
New criminal and maritime codes were made at the Riksdag
of 1862, and sanctioned by the government. Through
the new regulations passed in the same year the foundations
for increased municipal home rule were laid. Such home
rule was as old as the country itself, but, in the same degree
as the state organization, had attained a higher development,
and the centralization of the administration was realized;
it had weakened and was in peril of being entirely
lost. Now the time was come for the powers of state to
give municipal home rule new strength, adapting its old
forms and creating new ones, in accordance with modern
requirements. Laws were made which gave the towns the
right to elect members to local assemblies (<i>stadsfullmœgtige</i>),
with authority to act in behalf of their communities.
Similar institutions (<i>kommunalstæmmor</i>) were arranged for
the country communities. <i>Landsting</i> were instituted in
every governmental district, or <i>læn</i>, at which representatives,
elected by the people, were to take action on the pub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>lic
affairs of the district, especially on such that pertained
to sanitary conditions, communications, etc. The conditions
for suffrage and elective franchise in municipal affairs
were based on personal income. The old class distinctions
were thus disregarded and a return made to the still older
democratic institutions of the ancient Teutonic communities,
in which every free man is entitled to his word and vote in
public affairs. But those only are considered “free” who
by their work can gain enough to pay their taxes in return
for the privileges of a citizen. The church got a representation
of its own in the clerical assembly (<i>kyrkomœtet</i>), which
meets every fifth year and consists of equal numbers of ministers
and laymen.</p>

<p>The government in the municipal reforms found a basis
for the reorganization of the Riksdag. The royal proposition
for a new parliamentary representation, placed before
the Estates in 1862, was built upon the municipal suffrage
and the Landstings or district assemblies, the latter being
authorized to elect the members of the senate, or First
Chamber. The old system of representation corresponded
as little with the new municipal home rule as with the general
tendencies in politics and social life. The nobility had
lost its old importance. It was no longer advisable for the
clergy to take a leading part in political affairs. A new
industrial class of wealth and prominence had formed and
demanded a representation in the burgher class. The peasants
had ever since 1809 been carrying on their agitation for
a reduction of taxes and abolition of the class privileges.
They had met with an overwhelming opposition, which
would fall with the old system of representation. A parliamentary
reform had been fervently discussed ever since
1840. The municipal home rule reforms of 1862 had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
brought the question closer to a solution. The burghers
and peasants at the Riksdag of 1860 petitioned the government
to present a royal proposition for the reorganization
of the Diet. Baron Louis de Geer, the minister of justice,
was the author of this proposition, which was presented in
1862 and placed on the table until the next Riksdag. The
great question was acted upon at the Riksdag of 1865.
There was a great deal of commotion on account of the
opposition which was expected from the nobility and clergy.
The discussions in the periodical press and in pamphlet form
were lively. The country population preserved its peaceful
and sensible demeanor, but the excitement in the towns was
considerable and increased as the decision drew nearer.
The majority of towns and several rural communities in
their close proximity sent deputations to Stockholm, who
tendered their best wishes to the able minister of justice
for the success of his proposition. The commotion
in Stockholm was so great that troops were ordered
ready in case of an emergency. The 4th of December
the proposition was voted on by the burghers and
peasants. At the question of the speaker, whether they
were willing to accept the royal proposition, the peasants
rose to their feet in a body and gave their answer with one
laconic yea. A few of the burghers spoke against the proposition,
but it was carried also in their Estate, and by an
overwhelming majority. Long and heated discussions took
place among the nobility and clergy. The clergymen were
generally opposed to the parliamentary reform, but feared
to be found remaining as the only opponents in the storm of
disapproval which would follow. For this reason they postponed
their decision until the nobility had taken action upon
the proposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span></p>

<p>There rested a spirit of real grandeur over the deliberations
at the Riddarhus upon this occasion, when the question
of a voluntary surrender of the aristocratic privileges was
to be decided. The Swedish nobility had its class instincts
and prejudices, but very rarely it had been found lacking in
men of the loftiest patriotism and highest attainments, ever
ready to take the lead in the defence of the independence
of their country or to follow up faithfully the ambitions of
their great rulers. Arrangements had been made to allow
noblemen from distant parts and of very limited means to
be present, if not during the time of the discussions, which
lasted four days, at least at the casting of the vote. Never
in the memorable history of the knightly chapterhouse had
more eloquent language or loftier thoughts been heard than
upon this occasion. Both supporters and opponents of the
royal proposition spoke with great sagacity and discernment.
The former spoke of the inadvisability of a representation
by Estates and by hereditary privileges, and of the dangers
of a further postponement of the needed reform. The latter
nicely scrutinized the royal proposition, which was considered
to give too great influence to the peasants, to weaken
the executive power and to depend upon municipal reforms
as yet untried. They further considered the upper house,
or First Chamber, too homogeneous with the Second to be
able to exert the conservative or retaining power expected
from it. The members of the cabinet all spoke with fervor
and persuasive power in favor of the royal proposition,
especially De Geer, Gripenstedt and Carlson. The outcome
was that the royal proposition was accepted by a vote of 361
yeas against 294 nays. The nobility as a class thus left the
political arena voluntarily and with honor. Now the turn
was come to the clergy, who unanimously accepted the royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
proposition without further discussion. The result was
accepted with outbursts of enthusiasm from all over the
country, but especially from the towns. The four Estates
adjourned June 22, 1866, forever, and the law of the new
system of parliamentary representation was sanctioned the
same date.</p>

<p>The royal proposition, which became the law of a new
Diet, is based upon the principle of general elections. The
Riksdag meets at the commencement of every year. It is
divided into two houses or Chambers. The members of the
First Chamber, or upper house, are elected for a term of
nine years, partly by the Landstings, or district assemblies,
partly by the assemblies of towns which do not take part
in a Landsting. Elective to the First Chamber are those
who have a yearly income of at least $1,000 from some
business or enterprise, or as the interest on a capital of their
own. These members, or senators, must be at least thirty-five
years of age; they do not enjoy any compensation.
The members of the Second Chamber, or lower house, are
elected by every judicial district in the country which has
no more than 40,000 inhabitants and by every 10,000 inhabitants
of a town. Towns which have a population of
less than 10,000 inhabitants are joined into election districts
of from 6,000 to 12,000 inhabitants. Elective to the Second
Chamber are those who pay taxes on an income of at least
$200 a year and who are twenty-five years of age. These
members are compensated for the time spent at the Riksdag.
The ordinary Riksdag, which meets every year, lasts
for a period of at least four months. The extraordinary
Riksdag is called by the king whenever he finds it necessary.
The members of the cabinet are elective as members
of the Riksdag, and should, during all sessions, be present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
at the deliberations of the Chambers. The standing committees
remain the same as during the time of the old system.
Special and temporary committees are appointed
when considered necessary. When the two Chambers end
in a conflicting vote upon one and the same subject, the
committee which prepared it for discussion should try to
obtain a satisfactory solution. If such fails, the question
is dropped for that year. The expenses of state, the state
appropriations and the management of the national bank,
when involved, form exceptions to this rule and are voted
upon by both Chambers together, the majority of votes
from both making the decision.</p>

<p>A new era in Swedish history opens up with the acceptance
of the parliamentary reform. The constitution itself
had suffered no change, except in points of contact with the
new rules of the Riksdag. But the powers of state no
longer held to each other the same position as of yore. The
government hitherto had, in the very division into four
Estates, a support against powerful class and party interests.
An equally solid support was not to be expected
from a Riksdag of only two Chambers, which in questions
of state appropriations is practically one. For this reason
many would have preferred the establishment of a system
which, instead of abolishing the mediæval arrangement of
four Estates, would have added as many classes as there
are really extant in the modern state, to gain the desired
equilibrium through a manifold and dynamically operating
representation. As things shaped themselves after the two
Chamber system, the government ought more than ever
to have a conservative, retaining power in order to preserve
the proper balance. But such was not the case, for the
Riksdag had been placed in a position to watch and control<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
the executive power much closer than before, thanks to its
authority to fix for each year the appropriations and expenditures
of the state. The stipulation that the members
of the cabinet are to take part in the deliberations of the
Chambers gives another pillar of strength to the Riksdag.
If the ministers of state are to exert any influence upon the
decisions of the Riksdag, it is requisite to have its full confidence.
The king is forced to select for his cabinet such
members as are supposed to have an influence with the
representatives of the people. The influence of the Riksdag
has been steadily increasing ever since 1867.</p>

<p>While the issue of a parliamentary reform occupied the
attention of all public-spirited men, the interest in the political
situation of Europe was hardly less intense. The sympathy
with the unhappy Poles was almost feverish. In
1863 two motions were made at the Riksdag to petition the
government to take an active part in the restoration of the
kingdom of Poland, by means of diplomatic intervention.
The position of the government was a difficult one. The
complications between Denmark and Germany had recommenced,
and it was important to stand in good relations to
Russia. The Swedish public did everything to make these
relations precarious, by demonstrations of various kinds in
favor of Poland, warlike newspaper articles and subscriptions
of money to the leaders of the revolt. Thanks to the
sagacity and tactful demeanor of Manderstrœm and the
common sense of the Riksdag the motions in question were
defeated and a dangerous conflict avoided. Complications
of a more serious nature arose on account of the reopened
conflict between Denmark and Germany. The Danish government
had failed in its efforts to make a satisfactory
arrangement in the relations between the crown and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. The Germans repeatedly
mixed themselves up in the interior affairs of Denmark, and
the Danes themselves were divided into several parties.
King Frederic VII. at last concluded to give up the idea
of gathering in the duchies as integral parts of the kingdom,
satisfied to sacrifice the ultimate connection of Holstein and
Lauenburg with the crown, but resolved to connect the
originally Danish Schleswig with Denmark. The purely
German parts were, through the so-called “March Patent” of
1863, separated from the rest of the monarchy, while Schleswig
was reunited with it, according to the constitution. This
policy was approved by the Scandinavian party in Sweden
and Norway, supported by Swedish diplomacy, and, in the
first place, by Charles XV. himself. King Charles was
inspired by general sympathy with the Scandinavian movement
and by personal friendship for Frederic VII. to follow
up the Scandinavian policy of his father. The two Scandinavian
monarchs met twice during the summer of 1863
and influenced the Swedish-Norwegian and Danish cabinets
to draw the outline of a treaty of defence on the basis of the
river Eider as the Danish boundary to the south. The Danish
government made the proposition for a new constitution
according to which Schleswig was to be united to Denmark.
This was contrary to the promise made by King Frederic
to the German powers in 1852. The proposition for a new
constitution was placed before the Danish Diet and accepted.
Two days later, November 15, 1863, King Frederic suddenly
died, before he had sanctioned the new law. This was a
severe blow. The popular king left his beloved people in a
most inopportune moment, fraught with peril and disastrous
mistakes. The people of Schleswig and Holstein renewed
an old contention in regard to the right of succession. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
new Danish king, Christian IX., gave in to the pressure
brought to bear on him by his cabinet and the inhabitants
of Copenhagen. He signed the new constitution, which
gave to the German powers a valid excuse to interfere.
The Prussian and Austrian troops crossed the river Eider to
make good the agreements of 1852.</p>

<p>The Swedish-Norwegian government was placed in an
embarrassing position. The alliance of defence that was
planned was to a great extent based upon the relations of
personal friendship between Charles XV. and Frederic VII.
Sweden was not legally pledged to shield Denmark as a
consequence of the acceptance of the new constitution. But
Sweden had taken a conspicuous part in the deliberations,
for which reason a change of policy could not be made without
considerable difficulty. The liberal organs of the Swedish
press, headed by “Aftonbladet,” whose editor was
August Sohlman, did everything in their power to make
such a change an impossibility. But Sweden was not prepared
to make war on two of the great powers of Europe,
especially as no other power was willing to join in an alliance
in behalf of Denmark. The change must be made; and
was effected, principally because of the persuasive arguments
and resolute demeanor of Gripenstedt. King Charles resolved
to take the painful measures of a retreat. The
standpoint of his government he gave to the Riksdag in the
following words: “It cannot be expected from us that we
should place our sword on the scale of justice without considering
if the object can be attained with the resources at
our command.” It was a supreme sacrifice that Charles
XV. made when, for the safety of his countries, he was
forced to draw back the hand of support and comradeship
which he had offered a brother in distress. The noble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>-hearted
king, in one of his poems, has given a touching
expression of the sorrow he felt in being unable to assist
Denmark in her hour of peril. King Charles might, with
proper resources at his command, have proved a formidable
enemy. He had given evidence of possessing all the qualities
requisite for the make-up of a great general, without
doubt an inheritance from his two grandfathers, Prince
Bernadotte and Eugene Beauharnais. A few hundred
Swedish and Norwegian volunteers took an honorable part
in the Danish war, which was the only practical result of
the Scandinavian policy. The Swedish press was violent
in its attacks upon the government for its change of policy.
In March, 1864, the mob of Stockholm assailed the residences
of Manderstrœm, Gripenstedt and other cabinet
members, breaking the windows with stones.</p>

<p>Poor Denmark was left alone. Napoleon III. made the
mistake of not attempting to defeat Prussia before she had
reached her climax of strength. He was tied up with his
Mexican adventure and unwilling to help Denmark.
Charles XV. could not endure to see Denmark thus deserted.
Privately he offered Christian IX. an alliance
which stipulated that the three Scandinavian kingdoms
should be joined into a union with one common foreign
policy and common defence. Charles was also willing to
make the succession one, if necessary. This alliance was to
embrace only such parts of Denmark which were not to
enter the German union. Sweden-Norway would do their
utmost to prohibit a separation between Denmark and
Schleswig. Denmark refused to accept this offer. Her leading
statesman, Monrad, held stubbornly to the idea of an undivided
Danish monarchy. For this reason, Denmark was
for a second time abandoned to fight out alone her uneven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
battle. It ended in the loss of Holstein, Lauenburg and the
greater part of Schleswig, through the treaty of Vienna,
October 30, 1864. In Denmark a hard feeling against the
Swedes and Norwegians sprang up as a consequence of
the disastrous war fought without allies; and the Scandinavian
policy and enthusiasm had received a blow from
which they have never fully recovered. Charles XV. did all
in his power to revive them. He had the pleasure of uniting
the efforts of Sweden, Norway and Denmark in a peaceful
work of great significance, the first Scandinavian Exposition
of Industry and Art, which was opened at Stockholm
in June, 1866. The consequence was a perfect Norwegian
conquest of Sweden, in a cultured sense. The painters
Tidemand and Gude captured the prizes. The composers
Kierulf and Nordraak took the lead in song and music.
Ibsen and Bjornson became the craze in literature. The
literary contact with Norway was begun in 1861, when
Lorenz Dietriechson was appointed a docent at the University
of Upsala, and for the first time made the contemporary
Norwegian and Danish poets acquainted in Sweden.
What Sweden received from Norway was a quaint, late-born
Romanticism of a strong national flavor. When this
Romanticism was changed into stern Realism its influence
upon Swedish culture, especially her literature, was only
increased, Swedish literature receiving strong realistic impulses
from the neighboring Scandinavian countries. The
Norwegian influence ceased, when the Swedes at last became
aware that there was in it a deeply pessimistic trait,
akin to the stern Norwegian and Scotch Christianity, which
is incompatible with the Swedish national temperament,
slightly inclined to melancholy, but of a robust and irrepressible
desire to live and enjoy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span></p>

<p>Charles XV. followed up his practical Scandinavian
policy by marrying his only daughter Louise to Crown
Prince Frederic of Denmark. King Charles was as unsuccessful
in his noble efforts to unite more closely his two
kingdoms as in his foreign policy. The king allowed some
time to pass in order to let the ill-feeling, caused by the conflict
of 1859 and 1860, die out. In February, 1865, he
considered that the moment had arrived to institute the
review of the Act of Union. He appointed a committee
of Swedes and Norwegians to prepare the proposition of a
new Act of Union, on the basis of perfect equality and
right to decide separately all matters, except such pertaining
to the Union. The committee performed the work, but
their proposition was defeated at the Norwegian Storthing of
1871, at the instigation of John Sverdrup and K. Motzfeldt.
The Swedish Riksdag for this reason also failed to accept
it. At the close of the Riksdag, King Charles made the
following utterance in regard to the defeated proposition:
“What has now failed to attain success shall perhaps win
out without difficulty when the two nations once have
learned to place confidence in each other, as the result of a
more intimate intercourse.” He saw with great satisfaction
the completion of a railway which forever unites the
Swedish and the Norwegian capitals with ties of steel.</p>

<p>The administration of Charles XV. persevered in its
liberal policy concerning questions of economy and jurisprudence.
This was particularly noticeable in commercial
matters. The idea of free trade had won ascendency in
Europe. Napoleon III. had entered a treaty of commerce
with England, in strict opposition to the protective system.
Other nations were one by one admitted into the free-trade
system by means of new treaties. Sweden made a treaty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
of commerce and navigation in 1865. This step was severely
criticised by the Riksdag of 1865-1866, both from
a constitutional and financial point of view. Gripenstedt
was accused of leading the way over demolished industries,
but he defended his position with great eloquence. The
treaty was ratified in spite of the powerful opposition in the
Riksdag. The press condemned both the treaty and the
government in the most violent language.</p>

<p>The first Riksdag of the new parliamentary system met
January 19, 1867. The “Landstings” had sent to the
First Chamber the most prominent men of the country. It
was a truly representative gathering, a house of peers
elected by the people. Lagerbielke, the landtmarshal of the
preceding Riksdag, was appointed speaker. The Second
Chamber counted a larger number of peasants as representatives
than of any other class. Anton Nicolaus Sundberg,
then bishop of Carlstad, now archbishop of Sweden,
was made speaker of the Second Chamber. The power of
the peasants made itself felt at once. There was formed
a strong and influential party, the <i>landtmanna</i>, or countrymen’s
party, consisting of small landowners. The peasants
constituted the majority, but the party also counted
many titled and untitled country gentlemen in interests
united with them. The founder of the party was Count
Arvid Rutger Posse, later minister of state. Emil Key and
the peasants Charles Ifvarsson and Liss Olof Larsson were
among the leaders of the party. The policy of the Landtmanna
party demanded simplification of the administration,
economy in the matter of appropriations and a solution of
the questions of the defence and taxation in harmony with
the interests of the owners of the soil. The party followed
up its policy with stern consistency from Riksdag to Riks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>dag,
until in perfect control of the whole government. The
opposition consisted of “the Intelligence” or intellectual
party, which, without a solid constitution or a fixed policy,
has in vain fought the spreading influence and power of the
Landtmanna party. The latter has gone almost too far in
its endeavors for economical reform, but has also given
evidence of appreciation of the material needs of a cultural
development, appropriating large sums for the benefit of
science and education.</p>

<p>The army question was the most important issue of
Swedish politics. The events of 1866 had made it evident
that a strengthening of the defences was necessary. King
Charles was anxious to have the question solved in a satisfactory
manner, finding therein the only reliable safeguard
for the future independence of Sweden. It was apparent
that any attempts to settle the question in accordance with
the system adopted by Charles XI. would be devoid of
result. It was based upon direct taxation of the soil and
must be opposed by the strong majority of small landowners
of the Landtmanna party. A compromise policy was
for this reason begun in 1867, the question of an abolition
of the land tax being connected with the army question,
although the two ought to have had no connection. The
question was started with promises of a reduction or exemption
of the duties of the old army system as compensation
for the acceptance of a new arrangement for the country’s
defence. The government made an army proposition to the
Riksdag of 1869, promising several reductions to the landowners
who furnished soldiers according to the old system
(<i>indelningsverket</i>). The proposition was prepared
by a committee, of which the new minister of war, Gustavus
Rudolph Abelin, was the chairman. It was based<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
upon the preservation of the old system for the furnishing
of the body force of officers and men. The larger
force was to be provided for through militia. The militia
was to be drilled in the neighborhood of their various homes
during sixty days of the year. The proposition was not
accepted. The militia compulsory service, as the duty of
every citizen for the defence of his country, had nothing
to do with the regular army as provided by the stipulations
of the old system. But the majority of the Second Chamber
confused the two and refused to allow the establishment
of the former on a wider basis, because the offers made to
reduce the burdens of the old system did not appear to them
liberal enough. In 1871 another proposition was made by
Abelin to the Riksdag. It was similar to the first one, and
its cause was eloquently pleaded by Abelin, Axel Gustavus
Adlercreutz, minister of justice, Peter Axel Bergstrœm,
minister of civil service, and Gunnar Vennerberg, minister
of ecclesiastics. They warned against the mistake of attaching
impossible conditions to the acceptance of the proposition.
The proposition for an extended militia service was
accepted by both Chambers. But when the Second Chamber
raised, as a condition for its acceptance, the suspension,
for fifteen years, of the old system which provided for the
regular army, the government found it impossible to grant
this, and the proposition was dropped.</p>

<p>King Charles was grieved and vexed with the fate of the
army bills. The Franco Prussian war made it, in his opinion,
of added importance to Sweden to have her defences
remodelled. He called an extraordinary session of the
Riksdag, in the autumn of 1871, when Abelin brought out
a third proposition. It was chiefly of the same contents
as the preceding ones. But a remarkable change in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
public opinion had now taken place, as to the advisability
of retaining the old system. Men who looked upon the
question more from a military than an economic point of
view entertained doubts as to the practical value of the old
regular army as the body force of a compulsory militia.
Military officers commenced to attack the old system as the
basis of a new army. The Landtmanna party persevered
in the request for an abolition of the old system, and this
killed the army bill at the extraordinary Riksdag.</p>

<p>Together with the request for an abolition of the old
army system, demands for redemption from other burdens
placed upon the owners of the soil made themselves heard.
The land-tax was the principal one of these burdens and
caused as much difference of opinion as the army system.
The Landtmanna party considered the land-tax to be of the
same nature originally as other taxes, which ought to be
more evenly distributed and shared by all classes in the
same proportion. The Intelligence party was of the opinion
that the land-tax in the course of time had come to be
rents or mortgages which always were taken into consideration
at the exchange of property, as reducing the stock value
of the property in question. To free a present generation
from the payment of land-tax, was in the eyes of the opposition,
an injustice to the other classes whose taxes thereby
were to be increased. The Landtmanna party had, in 1869,
commenced an agitation for the reduction of the land-tax
for shorter periods and on a small scale at first, but with
increasing demands at every new Riksdag.</p>

<p>The government, whose members had been the champions
of parliamentary reform, was soon disregarded by the
triumphant party, while its old opponents never forgot it.
The earlier advisers of the king retired one by one when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
they saw their influence in the Riksdag vanish. King
Charles himself took the defeat of the army bills deep at
heart. His health commenced to fail in 1871, and when his
faithful consort died, in the same year, having exposed her
own health in her attempts to improve the condition of the
king, the latter grew worse. After a trip abroad for his
health, King Charles XV. died at Malmœ, September 18,
1872, deeply mourned by the two nations. In the following
year his youngest brother Nicolaus August, duke of Dalecarlia,
died, leaving only two of the children of Oscar
I., Oscar Frederic, duke of East Gothland, and Princess
Eugenie. The history of Charles XV. carries the principal
traits of his character. His sweeping reforms in social,
political and economical matters, and his great plans for the
future, even if sometimes immature, or high-strung, were
always characterized by loftiness of purpose. A typical
Swede both in his merits and his faults, this was the secret
of the immense popularity of King Charles, which always
followed him, although he never sought it.</p>

<p>The philosopher Christian Jacob Bostrœm is the most
popular of Swedish thinkers and the first who founded a
national system and school of philosophy, idealistic and
rational, and in strict opposition to the system of Hegel.
Bostrœm was born in Pitea, in 1797, was the teacher of the
sons of Oscar I., and succeeded the able philosopher Samuel
Grubbe, a talented follower of Hœijer, as professor of philosophy
at the University of Upsala. Bostrœm was a highly
fascinating and suggestive teacher, while he neglected his
literary production, which is neither exhaustive nor quite
representative of his philosophy. He exerted a considerable
influence by his outline of a philosophical state, which
pleased the conservatives, while a much more widespread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
and lasting impression was produced by his criticism of the
doctrines of a hell and a devil. A whole literature sprang
into life, discussing vehemently the existence or non-existence
of the fiend. To this literature and the works and
writings of Bostrœm is to be credited the spirit of religious
tolerance which characterized life and literature during the
reign of Charles XV. It fostered in the cultured few a
leaning toward Unitarianism or Theosophy, while it gave
rise to a shallow materialism and religious indifference in
the less cultured classes and individuals.</p>

<p>The artistic, literary and musical life bore a decided
resemblance to the intellectually interested but dilettantic
king. Charles XV. was surrounded by a great number of
painters who, although possessing a good deal of talent,
succeeded only in the smaller field of genre painting. Remarkable
exceptions are J. F. Hœckert, Marcus Larsson
and C. H. L. D’Uncker, who possessed sterling genius and
acquired great fame. Several promising painters, like
George von Rosen, developed later the full scope of their
power. The sculptor J. P. Molin was highly talented, a
worthy follower of B. E. Fogelberg, who had enriched
Swedish art with a number of highly important sculptures.</p>

<p>In the world of letters, the spirit of dilettantism was
more strongly felt than in art, Swedish literature, after its
several glorious epochs, experiencing one of its most stagnant
periods. A veritable giant among pygmies was Victor
Rydberg, whose remarkable novel, “The Last Athenian,”
appeared in 1859, but whose principal productivity as a poet
and scientist belongs to a later period. So do, to a great
extent, the best works of the poets Eduard Beckstrœm, also
an able dramatist, and Count Carl Snoilsky. Zacharias
Topelius, the Walter Scott and Hans Christian Andersen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
of Finland, must be mentioned here. Writing in the Swedish
language, and for his principal work using subjects of
Swedish history, he was as highly beloved in Sweden as in
Finland. His excellent series of historical novels, called
“The Surgeon’s Stories,” have been translated into several
languages. His juvenile stories are not characterized by the
same degree of inventive power as are the tales by Andersen,
but Topelius had the latter’s ability of placing himself in
intimate contact with the pure minds of all ages.</p>

<p>In the most national of Swedish cultural elements, the
song, the epoch of dilettantism found its most beautiful and
lasting expressions. The quartet and chorus singing at the
universities of Upsala and Lund was cultivated to the highest
standards of excellence and had a splendid repertory in
the songs of Otto Lindblad, Vennerberg, Prince Gustavus,
Josephsson, Crusell, Cronhamn, etc. The Upsala students
caused a great sensation by their singing at the Paris Exposition
of 1867, and have repeated their successes at the Paris
Exposition of 1878, and in Berlin in 1898. Swedish quartets
of men’s and women’s voices have travelled all over the
world and made a lasting fame for this minor but bewitching
branch of musical art. As dramatic singers of the first
rank, Louise Michaëli and Christine Nilsson have been the
worthy successors of Jenny Lind. To this period, as well
as to the next, belongs Elisa Hvasser, the greatest and most
versatile actress Sweden has ever had. This artist was
equally at home in the farce and melodrama, but excelled
in the tragic parts of the Shakespeare, Schiller, and Ibsen
repertory. Indispensable in their positions at the Royal Theatre
of Stockholm, Michaëli, the songstress, and Hvasser,
the tragedienne, did not travel, thereby losing the fame a
world would have been only too glad to give them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Progress and Prosperity&mdash;Oscar II</i></span></h2>

<p>Oscar II. ascended the throne at a moment when
universal peace was restored after the great conflict
between France and Germany, and when an
age of commercial prosperity for Sweden seemed to have
begun. King Oscar had received the same superior education
as his older brothers, is as brilliantly gifted as they
were and of a more scholarly mind. As a writer on scientific
subjects, a poet and an orator, Oscar II. had distinguished
himself before his succession to the throne. The
new king offered the best of securities for a sound administration
in his thorough and versatile knowledge, wide experience
in public affairs, and rich and harmonious endowment.
Oscar II. still did not find it easy to gain the love
and admiration of the Swedish people, of which he is so
eminently worthy. He was the successor of one of the most
popular of rulers that the country ever saw, but King Oscar
has lived to see his own popularity almost outrival that of
his predecessor. King Oscar is, at seventy, a handsome,
spirited gentleman, with that dignity which age, rare attainments,
high intelligence and a noble soul grant their common
possessor. This the most learned and popular monarch
of Europe is of a tall, commanding figure, six feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
three inches in height, of a handsome, expressive face, with
cheeks of a ruddy color and mild blue eyes.</p>

<p>Oscar II. has shown great discernment in his arrangement
of dynastic matters. Himself married to the fervently
religious Princess Sophie of Nassau, the king has
married his oldest son, Crown Prince Gustavus Adolphus,
to Princess Victoria of Bade, a granddaughter of Emperor
William I. of Germany, and a great-granddaughter of
Gustavus IV. of Sweden. His third son, Prince Charles,
duke of West Gothland, is married to Princess Ingeborg of
Denmark, a granddaughter of Charles XV. of Sweden.
These unions are well calculated to accentuate the increasing
political, commercial and cultural intimacy with Germany,
the Scandinavian policy of his predecessor and the
desire of King Oscar to see the descendants of the old royal
line of Sweden as heirs to the crown. In giving his consent
to the marriage of his second son, Prince Oscar (Bernadotte),
to Lady Ebba Munck, of the Swedish nobility, King
Oscar has given evidence of the fact that he is not a match-maker
regardless of the feelings of the parties involved.
Prince Oscar, formerly Duke of Gothland, upon renouncing
his share of inheritance to the two thrones, was allowed to
marry the choice of his heart. King Oscar has tried to heal
the wounds of the past by opening the vaults of the church
of Riddarholm to the sarcophagi of Gustavus IV. and his
son, and by giving Queen Carola of Saxony, the only living
granddaughter of the former, repeated proofs of esteem and
considerate distinction.</p>

<p>King Oscar with his crowns had received as an inheritance
two important problems to be solved&mdash;the reorganization
of the Swedish army and the settlement of the difficulties
in the relations between the two states of the Union.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
The latter has not yet found a satisfactory solution, although
the king has devoted to it his most strenuous attention
and the best of his efforts, in honest application to his
royal motto: “The Weal of the Brother Nations.”</p>

<p>The reorganization of the Swedish army was not effected
until after twenty years of parliamentary struggle. The
road of a compromise policy which was opened in 1867 was
followed up at the Riksdag of 1873, in all the long chain
of years royal army bills being repeatedly rejected. In
1885 the government and Riksdag agreed on a remission
of thirty per cent of the military taxes of landowners in
exchange for new regulations for the militia compulsory
service. In 1887 the Riksdag sanctioned the total abolition
of the “indelta,” or cantoned troops, as far as the navy was
concerned, which was the first step toward the reorganization
of the navy, and the same year the militia law of 1885
went into effect.</p>

<p>The old Landtmanna, or agrarian party, in 1888 gave
place to a new protectionistic party. A contested election
of twenty-two members from Stockholm gave a sudden
majority to the protectionists, O. R. Themptander, the able
minister of state, resigning. The army bill did not fare
well at first. In spite of the fact that the Landtmanna
party was brushed aside, the old enemies of an army reform,
the landowners, nobles and peasants alike, still being
strong enough to successfully oppose it. The Riksdag of
1888 passed a grain tariff, which went into effect February
14th of the same year, enforcing several other points of a
protective tariff system.</p>

<p>King Oscar called an extraordinary, or special, session
of the Riksdag, October 18, 1892, when royal propositions
were offered and accepted. The land-tax was abolished and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
a new army bill passed. According to the stipulations of
the latter, the <i>beværingstid</i>, or period of liability for every
citizen to bear arms, was extended to embrace twenty years
instead of twelve, viz., eight years in the first ban of the
<i>landtværn</i>, or militia, four years in the second ban, and
eight years in the <i>landstorm</i>, or final levy. The first ban of
militia is in time of war to form an integral part of the
first fighting line, the second ban forming a reserve for
the first fighting line. The final levy is to be called out
for garrison duty exclusively, and for the defence of the
country against foreign invasion. Six military districts
have been established, five distributed along the entire coast
of Sweden, the sixth inland in the western provinces to be
a reserve ready to be used at the point and moment most
needed. The reorganized army in active service is composed
of <i>værfvade</i>, or enlisted troops, and <i>indelta</i>, or cantoned
troops, the expenses also of the latter being paid by
the government. The royal guards, chasseurs, hussars,
artillery, and engineers are enlisted for two years up to
eight. The militia troops are distributed among both the
enlisted and the cantoned troops, the length of service with
the colors being ninety days in time of peace. The infantry
in which all the cantoned troops serve consist of twenty-six
regiments and two battalions. The line is armed with
Remingtons of 8.8 millimetres calibre. There are eight
regiments of cavalry and six regiments and six batteries
of field artillery, forty batteries in all, with 240 cannon.
The effective of the active army, in 1896, was 1,953 officers,
571 employees, 1,779 non-commissioned officers, 1,641 musicians
and 38,802 men, with 6,852 horses. The war effective
is 272,994 men, besides 180,000 in the <i>landstorm</i>. The
chief fortifications of Sweden are Carlscrona, on the south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
coast; two fortresses outside of Stockholm, viz., Vaxholm
and Oscar Fredericsborg; and, in the interior, Carlsborg,
near Lake Vetter. The navy comprises 4 turret ships, with
10-inch armor, armed each with 2 10-inch and 4 5.9-inch
guns, and having a total displacement of 12,450 tons; 4
armor clad monitors, 9 armored gunboats, 3 corvettes,
9 first-class and 5 second-class gunboats, 2 torpedo cruisers,
7 first-class and 9 second-class torpedo boats, 5 torpedo
launches, and 12 school ships. The navy is manned by 267
officers and about 4,500 sailors, not including conscripts
to the number of 8,500 men. The entire cost of the defence
of Sweden exceeds ten million dollars a year.</p>

<p>The movement for a reorganization of the defences has
not been caused by any change in the policy of peace, which
has faithfully been carried out by all the rulers of the
Bernadotte dynasty. The ruler of Sweden and her people
desire peace, but not as a gift of mercy from the great
powers, but as a self-chosen right which can be effectively
defended if necessary. The ever-increasing armament of
the European powers has made a strengthening of the
Swedish arms unavoidable, but the Swedish government
was the first to announce its readiness to accept the invitation
of Czar Nicholas II. of Russia to a conference for the
discussion of a general reduction of the regular armies.
Germany was made the pattern for the reorganization of
the army and navy, the Swedish government having followed
the German also in the treatment of the labor question,
with schemes of accident and old-age insurance, accepted
by the Riksdag.</p>

<p>King Oscar, at his succession to the throne, gave evidence
of his desire to meet the reasonable demands of his
Norwegian subjects. He sanctioned, in 1873, the abolition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
of the office of a governor-general of Norway, the government
at Christiania to be presided over by a Norwegian
minister of state. To the later Norwegian demands for
a separate flag, consular service and ministry of foreign
affairs, King Oscar has been unyielding. The flag question
is of subordinate importance. King Oscar, in 1899, has
refused to sanction the resolution of the Storthing, three
times passed, for a flag without the mark of Union, for the
reason that the flag with that mark was offered to Norway
by his father, Oscar I., and gratefully accepted when the
country had no colors at all, except the Swedish. The
Swedish people will carry their old flag with the mark of
Union, irrespective of any changes made in the Norwegian
colors. More serious are the questions of consular and
diplomatic service. In 1893, the Swedish government offered
to compromise by establishing a common ministry of
foreign affairs whose head might be indifferently a Swede
or a Norwegian. This was rejected by the Norwegian
Storthing. The same offer was made in 1837, when the
dispute first arose, provided that the Norwegian troops
should share the duty of the common defence of both kingdoms.
The Swedish Riksdag of 1893 passed a resolution,
in compliance with which King Oscar for a second time
refused to sanction the bill of Norwegian consulates.</p>

<p>The diametrically opposite views which are held in regard
to the relations of Sweden and Norway are, to a great
extent, caused by a misconception of the nature of the
Union. In lack of a Union parliament, it has by many
been considered to be only a personal union of two countries
under the same king. Such is not the case. It is true that
the two countries are both free and independent states and
that the king is the only visible bond between them, accord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>ing
to the Act of Union, but the Union is nevertheless an
<i>actual</i> and not a <i>personal</i> one. If it was only personal, the
king could at will, or when forced to do so, resign his power
in one of the countries and continue his reign in the other.
The Act of Union cannot be changed except upon a resolution,
enacted in both of the respective diets, and with the
sanction of the king in behalf of the Union. A change can
be made at the same Swedish Riksdag at which it is proposed,
at the Norwegian Storthing not until the next regular
session. As a consequence the Union cannot be dissolved
by the representatives of either country alone, and the king
cannot dissolve it by exercising any power of his own. The
king cannot abdicate one throne without abdicating the
other, for the first paragraph of the Act of Union stipulates
that the two countries shall be indissolubly and irrevocably
united under the rule of the same king. No abdication can
be granted, except by common consent of the two diets in
joint session. When the two thrones are empty, without
an heir-apparent, a new king shall be elected by the two
diets in common. What underlies the Norwegian claims
of a separate foreign ministry is, besides to own an outward
sign of the country’s independence, a desire for a
closer constitutional control of diplomatic affairs. From
the Swedish side the desirability of a Union parliament and
a greater authority for the Union government has been
expressed. The Swedes have been found unwilling to grant
any change of the constitution of the Union, except the
right be added for the Union government to dispose of the
military forces of both countries, in equal proportion, for
the common defence. King Oscar’s standpoint in the
Unionist conflict has contributed much to increase his popularity
in Sweden, where his firm refusal to sanction any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
measure which would cause a weakening to the Union has
been received with the highest approval.</p>

<p>A committee to review the relations of the Union and
propose a revision of its charter was appointed in 1897, but
failed to accomplish anything, the views of the Swedish and
Norwegian members differing too radically in their opinions.
It is to be hoped that the ultimate solution of the
unionist conflict, whensoever it come or whatsoever it be,
will bring the two countries of the Scandinavian peninsula
closer together, without any great sacrifice on either side,
least of all of their independence.</p>

<p>During the more than eighty years of peace which Sweden
has enjoyed under the rule of the Bernadotte dynasty,
she has developed her constitutional liberty and her material
prosperity in a high degree. The dreams of glory by
conquest belong to days gone by, but in the fields of peaceable
industries she has attained a greatness which the world
begins to realize. At the expositions of Paris in 1867, 1878
and 1889, of Vienna in 1873, of Philadelphia in 1876 and of
Chicago in 1893, Swedish industry and art have taken part
with honor in the international competition. The railways
of Sweden have incessantly spun a more and more extended
network of steel over the country, opening connections for
enterprises in new districts and furthering commerce and
industrial art in a wide measure. Oscar II. is an enthusiastic
friend of railway improvements, the state having built
and acquired a quite considerable length of road at his initiative.
The length of Swedish railways, in 1896, was 6,145
miles, of which 2,283 miles belonged to the state, compared
to a total of 1,089 miles of Norwegian railways.</p>

<p>The post-office, which was made a government department
by Axel Oxenstierna, in 1636, annually transmits 130<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
million letters and parcels. The telegraph lines have not
reached a very high state of development; still there are
14,600 miles of telegraph. The telephone has made much
more progress, far surpassing that of any other country
in Europe. The total length of the connections exceeds
40,000 miles, and the number of apparatus is more than
25,000. Stockholm makes the widest use of the telephone
of any city in the world, with her 300,000 inhabitants
having a telephone for every thirty. Sweden has
developed into a commercial country of no inconsiderable
rank, notwithstanding her isolated position. Exports and
imports each exceed yearly in value $100,000,000, the imports
being 344,290,000 kronor and the exports 311,434,000
kronor in value, in 1895, a Swedish krona being about
twenty-eight cents. The commercial value of the foreign
trade amounts to thirty-nine dollars in yearly average for
each inhabitant of Sweden, which is about as much as in
France. The imports chiefly consist of coal, coffee, salt,
cotton and wool, while the exports are timber products,
about forty per cent of the whole, iron and steel, the best
in the world, machinery, butter, cattle, matches, etc. The
inland navigation and commerce are very lively. The state
finances are in a prosperous condition. The budget of
1898 showed total receipts of 120,086,000 kronor, of which
14,229,000 was surplus from proceeding budgets.</p>

<p>Thanks to the well equipped and regulated system of
instruction, the general education has been so highly advanced
that Sweden, in this respect, holds the very front
rank among the nations. Besides the national universities
of Upsala and Lund and the state medical college of Stockholm,
city universities at Stockholm and Gothenburg have
been recently founded which are quickly developing. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
study at the universities consists of post-graduate work,
there being about thirty colleges in various parts of the
country which lead their pupils as far as the demands
requisite for entering the universities. The Swedish university
courses are of unexcelled thoroughness and completeness.
The so-called Peasant High Schools are peculiar
to Scandinavia, having originated in Denmark. There are
twenty-five such high schools in Sweden, which give to
young men and women of the peasant class a higher education
than is available in the common schools, of which latter
there are 10,702, with 692,360 pupils and 13,797 teachers.</p>

<p>Scientific research progresses with energy and success,
and Sweden possesses to-day a great number of eminent
scholars, even if the epoch of men of universal genius appears
to be a thing of the past there as elsewhere. Swedish
scientists have opened closer relations with their co-workers
in all parts of the world. The energy of King Oscar has
brought about several congresses of science at Stockholm.
In the natural sciences, Sweden still holds an honored place,
in physics offering two great names, Eric Edlund and A. J.
Angstrœm, the latter celebrated for his work on the solar
spectrum, which forms the basis for the spectral analysis.
Death has claimed these men and also J. A. H. Gyldén,
an eminent astronomer; J. G. Agardh, C. W. Blomstrand,
H. O. Nathorst, J. E. Rydquist, able botanist, chemist,
agriculturist, and philologist, respectively; Pontus Wikner,
the most remarkable of the disciples of the philosopher
Bostrœm, and Victor Rydberg, the philosophical poet,
novelist and polyhistor.</p>

<p>Among the most noteworthy of living Swedish scholars
are Adolph Norén, Axel Koch and Esaias Tegnér, Junior,
philologists; Hans Hildebrand and Oscar Montelius, archæ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>ologists;
P. Fahlbeck, Nils and Magnus Hœjer, Martin
Weibull, Ernest Carlson, historians; A. M. Mittag-Leffler,
mathematician; Hugo Hildebrandsson, meteorologist; E. A.
H. Key, E. O. T. Westerlund, Anton Wetterstrand, F. J.
Biornstrœm, T. F. Hartelius, Curt Wallis, prominent in
various branches of medical science.</p>

<p>King Oscar with fervent interest and unfailing liberality
has encouraged various scientific explorations, and has had
the satisfaction to see the greatest geographical discoveries
of the century successfully made by Swedes, the circumnavigation
of Asia and Europe, and the discovery of the
Northeast Passage by Baron N. A. E. Nordenskiold, and
the exploration of Central Asia by Sven Hedin, which has
forever settled the learned disputes of ages. A third expedition,
the most daring of scientific exploits ever attempted,
still keeps the world in suspense as to its final outcome.
July 11, 1897, S. A. Andrée, a scientifically experienced
aëronaut, with two companions, Nils Strindberg and Knut
Frænkel, started in a balloon constructed for the purpose,
and with provisions for three years, from an island of
Spitzbergen, with the purpose of reaching the North Pole.
The daring aëronauts have not been heard from since their
departure, but authorities like Baron Nordenskiold have
expressed the best of hopes that they may have reached
Franz Joseph’s Land in safety, whence they might regain
settled regions.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> S. A. Andrée belongs to a class of men,
the Swedish engineers, who have won distinction for their
ability, and on whom the examples set by Christopher
Polhem and John Ericsson have had a stimulating influ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>ence.
There are among them two inventors of the very
first rank, who belong to the reign of Oscar II., Alfred
Nobel (d. 1896), the inventor of dynamite, and Gustavus
de Laval, the Swedish Edison. The latter is world-famous
for his separator and other inventions, which have revolutionized
the dairy industry. Alfred Nobel, the disciple of
John Ericsson, has not only the glory of having invented
one of the most useful helpers of mechanic and industrial
progress, but also that of having set aside his vast fortune,
amounting to something like $12,500,000, for public purposes.
The money is so invested as to constitute a fund
the interest of which shall be applied to five equal annual
prizes, to be awarded for the most important discovery or
improvement in chemistry, physics or medicine, for the
work in literature highest in the ideal sense, and to the one
who shall have acted most and best for the fraternity of
nations, the suppression or reduction of standing armies,
and the constitution and propagation of peace congresses.
The first prize, physics and chemistry, shall be awarded by
the Academy of Science of Sweden; that for physiology and
medicine by the Carolin Institute of Stockholm; the literary
prize by the Swedish Academy; and that for the propagation
of peace by a commission of five members elected by
the Norwegian Storthing. He especially directed that in distributing
these prizes no consideration of nationality shall
prevail, so that he who is most worthy of it shall receive
the reward, whether he be Scandinavian or not. It seems
that the sum of each of the five annual prizes thus instituted
will amount to $75,000. The inventor of dynamite was
deeply interested in all that was done to promote peace by
congresses and societies. He always considered that by improving
war material, and thus increasing the dangers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
war, he was contributing his share toward the pacification
of the world. Alfred Nobel has, by the manner in which
the Norwegian Storthing is made an active party in the disposition
of his will, indicated <i>his</i> view upon the Union of
Sweden and Norway and his hopes for a peaceful solution
of their conflicts.</p>

<p>Swedish literature, after the period of dilettantism and
epigones, has, during the reign of Oscar II., twice been
rejuvenated and continues its development on broadened
paths and with a wider scope. The eighties were characterized
by a strong realistic movement, which went far
in daring truth of description and brought problems of a
social, religious and political nature under discussion in
works of a novelistic or dramatic form. In naturalism,
it never went to the extremes of the other Scandinavian
literature. The movement was to a great extent brought
on by Norwegian and Danish influence, and soon subsided
for want of solid and fascinating art to maintain it. The
Swedish champion of this movement, although without the
restrictions of any school, was August Strindberg, a genius
of extraordinary endowment. Through the versatility and
power of his talent, he created new forms for the Swedish
drama, novel, short story and essay. In his battle against
reactionary conservatism he went too far; an excitable
nature, led into extremes, but he has had the manly courage
to confess and regret his mistakes. Strindberg, who is an
able historian, ethnographer, naturalist and sinologue, is the
most versatile and prolific of contemporary writers. In the
wide scope of his genius and originality of his methods,
Strindberg is one of the most remarkable dramatists that
ever lived. His autobiographical works are of supreme
importance, both to the students of literature and psychol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>ogy.
Among his masterpieces are “Master Olof,” the great
historic drama of his youth, “Swedish Fates and Adventures,”
and “Utopia Realized,” two series of short stories,
and “The Father,” a modern drama of unsurpassed tragic
grandeur.</p>

<p>Several women took an active part in the literary discussion
of social problems, with more or less justice considered
as the champions of women’s rights. Among these Anne
Charlotte Leffler, duchessa di Cajanello, in spite of her
premature death, developed into a novelist of merit who
will be placed side by side with Bremer, Knorring and
Carlén.</p>

<p>The golden lyres of Romanticism were silenced and the
epigones were hushed by the sarcasms of Realism. Count
Snoilsky and Victor Rydberg were the only poets of the
earlier period who sang with inspiration and were listened
to. After the realistic movement of the eighties came a
romantic reaction with new lyrics and new novelists, who
avoided the ruthlessness of the realists, but had profited by
their merits. This new movement cannot be called a school,
for it is marked by its great versatility of subjects and great
elasticity of treatment. If the definition of realistic art
be “a piece of nature seen through a temperament,” that
of the new movement may be “an artistic temperament
attuned to pieces of nature,” a sensitive and supple talent
which has an almost unlimited capacity to tell every story
just in the vein its particular subject demands. Pre-eminent
in this movement stand Ola Hansson, Selma Lagerlœf,
Verner von Heidenstam, Gustaf af Geijerstam, Peter Hallstrœm,
Thor Hedberg, Oscar Levertin, all fine novelists,
almost all good poets, and Geijerstam, an able dramatist.
One of the most interesting and supremely gifted poets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
Sweden has ever had is Gustaf Frœding, who generally
excels, sometimes abuses, his remarkable versatility in finding
a true lyric expression for the very widest range of subjects.
Sigurd Hedenstierna is the most popular humorist,
witty in his sketches, but impossible as a novelist. The
greatest humorists are August Strindberg and Gustaf
Frœding. Contemporary Sweden has very few and no
great literary critics, but some good literary historians
in Henric Schueck, Karl Warburg and Oscar Levertin.
She has a number of able journalists, most distinguished
among whom is their Nestor, S. A. Hedlund, of Gothenburg,
a fiery but dignified champion of a liberal government,
religious tolerance, social evolution and cultural
progress.</p>

<p>Swedish literature has a long pedigree compared to
Swedish art, which is hardly more than two centuries old.
All the more remarkable, then, is its rapid growth and high
degree of excellence. The first school of Swedish painters
was founded by the German Ehrenstrahl, giving to Swedish
art the cosmopolitan character it has preserved to this day,
influenced by continental but chiefly French art. Swedish
painters early attracted attention abroad. Gustavus Lundberg,
with a picture of Boucher and his wife, won the
greatest success of the Salon of Paris, in 1743. Peter
Adolphus Hall, “painter to the king and the children of
France,” has been called the Van Dyck of the miniature
painters. He resided in Paris up to the time of the revolution
and took part in the storming of the Bastile. Alexander
Roslin was, from the year 1760, installed in the
Louvre as painter to the king and councillor of the French
Academy. In 1771 he carried home a prize which the immortal
Greuze could not capture, much to the dismay of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
Diderot, and died as the most famous and wealthy artist
of the period. In a later period, Italy attracted many
Swedish artists, and later still, in the sixties of the present
century, the influence of Germany, especially of the Dusseldorf
school, was strongly felt. John Frederic Hœckert
won the first prize of the Paris Exposition of 1855 with his
large picture “Divine Service in the Lapmark.” When the
glories of Hœckert were almost forgotten at home, Edward
Wahlberg, in the seventies, was ushered into celebrity as
one of the greatest landscape painters of modern times,
equally appreciated in Germany, as later in France, and new
French laurels were won by Hugo Salmson, William von
Gegerfelt and August Hagborg. Since then French influences
have become solidly established, with a few important
artists of the Munich school, like C. G. Hellquist and
Julius Kronberg. The climax of artistic honors was
reached by Nils Forsberg, whose picture, “The Death
of a Hero,” carried home the first prize of the French
Salon in 1888 (not an exposition medal), a distinction which
no Swede and exceedingly few non-French artists ever won.
The repeated successes which Swedish painters have won
at expositions of Europe were more than duplicated by
the enthusiastic approval granted it at the World’s Fair
in Chicago in 1893. The truth is that Sweden possesses
a number of eminent painters in every branch of painting,
except the marine, which has been but sparingly represented
since the days of Marcus Larsson. The most famous among
them are, besides those already mentioned, Richard Bergh,
Oscar Biorck, Eva Bonnier, Gustavus Cederstrœm, Prince
Eugene, Eugene Jansson, Ernst Josephson, Nils Kreuger,
Carl Larsson, Bruno Liljefors, Charles Nordstrœm, Allan
Œsterlind, Georg and Hanna Pauli, George von Rosen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
Robert Thegerstrom, and A. L. Zorn. It has been said
of the Swedish painters, by way of complaint, that they
are not, as their brethren in Denmark and Norway, in any
marked degree national. Swedish art has, for its characteristic
boldness and superiority in modern technique, loftiness
of purpose, great individuality of expression and depth of
feeling. Be these characteristics national or cosmopolitan,
the Swedish painters are certainly a great credit to their
country. To King Oscar it must be in a high degree satisfactory
to see the artistic tendencies of his family culminate
in the works of his youngest son, Prince Eugene, who,
being in the front line of the advance corps of art, paints,
from dreamy, inner life, pictures which are the delight of
artists and true connoisseurs.</p>

<p>The sculptors are less numerous, but the art of Sergel,
Fogelberg and Molin have found worthy perpetuators and
innovators in Per Hasselberg, John Bœrjesson, Frithiof
Kjellberg, Alfred Nystrœm, Christian Ericsson, Th. Lundberg
and Ingel Fallstedt. To the art of metal engraving
on coins and medals Sweden has offered some works of the
very highest value by J. E. Ericson, P. H. Lundgren, Lea
Ahlborn and Adolphus Lindberg.</p>

<p>Architecture cannot boast of any continuous chain of
brilliant development. Since the days of Nicodemus Tessin
there have been few great architects until in very recent
times, when architecture has received a sudden impetus
which has made its progress and results as remarkable, or
almost more so, than that of the other arts. To Helgo
Zettervall a number of elaborate national works of construction
and restoration have been intrusted and, as a
rule, carried through in a meritorious manner, although
sometimes giving occasion for serious criticism. An im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>portant
influence was exerted by Frederic William Scholander,
more by his teaching than by his works. It is principally
his pupils who in the last few decades have almost
revolutionized the building methods and architectural aspect
of the capital, and endowed Gothenburg and other towns
with works of architectural distinction. Pre-eminent among
modern architects are I. G. Clason, Gustavus Wickman,
K. F. von Gegerfelt, Adrian Peterson, Hans Hedlund,
Valfried Karlson, A. F. Anderberg, E. Lallerstedt. The
Vasa, or Swedish Castle Renaissance, which with good
effect has been reintroduced for monumental buildings,
seems to lead architecture on to a wholesome national
development, combining impressive outlines and solidity
with elaboration and grace of interior decoration.</p>

<p>The foremost composers of orchestral music have been
mentioned above. Sweden maintains her reputation as
being the country of song through the compositions by
Hedenblad, Kœrling, Svedbom, Sjœgren and Arlberg,
while Sœderman has brought the form of the ballad, based
on national folk music, to the highest development. The
royal opera of Stockholm recently moved into new and
elegant quarters erected on the site of the old opera house
built by Gustavus III. It possesses, in Caroline Œstberg,
Mathilde Linden, Arvid Œdman, C. F. Lundquist and J.
Elmblad, dramatic singers of high rank, while Sweden, in
Louise Pyk, Mathilde Grabow Taube and Solomon Smith,
owns concert singers of great eminence. The international
firmament of song has two Swedish stars of considerable
magnitude in Sigrid Arnoldsson-Fischhoff, a colorature
songstress, and Ellen Nordgren-Gullbrandson, a Wagner
singer. The greatest actor is Emil Hillberg, a noble
creator of Ibsen and Strindberg rôles, while the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
recently lost its ablest comedian in the death of Knut
Almlœf.</p>

<p>Sweden of to-day offers an attractive picture of a country
in a high degree cultured and prosperous, but no country
or period is entitled to reap only benefits or enjoy undisturbed
happiness. No progress is obtained without struggle
and relapses, and a good must give way for something
better. Beneath a surface generally smiling and serene
formidable religious and social forces are in motion. The
Swedish state church is divided into two camps, which
resemble a high and a low church, out of which the whole
may come forward strengthened and rejunevated. The
various sects are not all satisfied with the degree of liberty
they enjoy. A shallow materialistic movement of anti-religious
tendencies, which styled itself Utilitarian, caused some
sensation in the latter eighties and early nineties, more
through the somewhat too severe manner in which it was
suppressed than through any of its own merits. There are
agitators for a separation of state and church who are
opposed by some of the stanchest friends of a constitutional
monarchy. A separation of educational and church
affairs seems desirable. The yeomen have regained the
predominant position in political life which was theirs in
the time of the ancient Teutonic communities, using their
power in a way which is not always beneficial to the other
classes or the state at large. The great class of country
population, which has been in vain striving to rise to the
privileged class of landowners, if even on the smallest
scale, have emigrated in vast numbers. The emigration,
which has given America at least 1,200,000 inhabitants of
Swedish birth or parentage, is one of the most astounding
phenomena of the century. It has, to a large extent, sub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>sided,
but may be revived if the pressure for social improvement
is found of no avail. The workingmen are resolved
to gain a representation and are striving to attain the introduction
of general suffrage. The weapons they use are
principally strikes, but may also turn to wholesale emigration.
In 1893 the advocates of universal suffrage arranged
for the election of a convention by popular vote, the first
Folksriksdag, which addressed an appeal to the legal Riksdag,
to consider an amendment for the extension of the
suffrage. The liberals and radicals are interested in this
agitation, and brought out their full vote to the Folksriksdag.
The conservative party ignores the whole movement,
probably not wisely. The towns are seeking an extended
representation and bitterly oppose the curtailment of the
rights already enjoyed, fearing the reactionary tendencies
of the conservatives, who have their strength in the large
agrarian population. Anarchism is something unknown
in Sweden. The socialistic agitation, which is spreading
among the classes without a political representation, is carried
on without any great bitterness and entirely without
lawless means.</p>

<p>Any practical or theoretical agitation for a republic there
is none in Sweden, the population as a whole not finding
salvation from the defects of government or society in any
outward change of rule. Civil service is enforced to the
letter, and the social pressure from above downward is of a
nature caused by financial or educational supremacy only
and would remain the same under republican rule. The
Swedes are proud of their history and the long and unbroken
chain of their political and social development. Their
neighbors accuse them of having traces of the chauvinism
of bygone days, but not altogether with justice. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
national anthem of Sweden can be quoted in their justification.
It speaks, in one instance, of the country as enthroned
on memories of a glorious past when its name
filled the world; but that name is the North, to whose
grandeur and loveliness of nature the whole song is a panegyric.
The name of Sweden is not even mentioned, a fact
which does not point to a narrow or antiquated form of
patriotism. There is in the nature of the Swedes a tendency
to delight in the display of dignified luxury, which
was known to Tacitus. The Swedes love to see the crown
of one of the oldest states of Europe carried with dignity
as an emblem of their ancient independence. The
Swedish king has in reality less power than the President
of the United States, but the Swedes have an inherited
faculty of confidence and loyalty of which their king receives
his full share. The Swedes become excellent citizens
of a republic for that very reason: reverence for, and loyalty
to, the institutions and historial development of the
country in which they dwell. Among the Scandinavian
nationalities, the Swede has been characterized as the nobleman
or aristocrat, on account of his love of luxury and the
joys of life, his dignity, diplomatic talent and lyrico-rhetoric
temperament. It is true that his dignity seldom forsakes
the Swede; when it does, something of the soldier of the
Thirty Years’ War comes to the surface. To her diplomatic
talent, more than to her glorious victories, Sweden owes
her superiority in size, prosperity and political importance,
as compared to her Scandinavian neighbors.</p>

<p>The fundamental laws of the kingdom of Sweden are:
1. The constitution of June 6, 1809; 2. The amended regulations
for the formation of the Riksdag of June 22, 1866;
3. The law of royal succession of September 26, 1810; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
on the liberty of the press of July 16, 1812. According to
these statutes, the king must be a member of the Lutheran
church, and have sworn fealty to the laws of the land. His
person is inviolable. He has the right to declare war and
make peace after consulting the state council. He nominates
to all higher appointments, both military and civil;
concludes foreign treaties, and has a right to preside in the
supreme court of justice. The princes of the blood royal
are excluded from all civil employments. The king possesses
legislative power in matters of political administration,
but in all other respects that power is exercised by the
Riksdag, in concert with the sovereign, and every new law
must have the assent of the crown. The right of imposing
taxes is vested in the Riksdag. The executive power is in
the hands of the king, who acts under the advice of a cabinet
or state council, the head of which is the minister of
state. It consists of ten members, seven of whom are ministerial
heads of departments and three without departments.
All the members of the cabinet are responsible for the acts
of the government.</p>

<p>Eric Gustavus Bostrœm is minister of state, holding
office since 1891, after the protectionists had got into power
and the compromise cabinets which followed were a thing
of the past. The other ministers without departments,
Baron A. L. E. Akerhielm and S. H. Wikblad, have remained
in office since the days of compromise cabinets. The
other members who have been in office from five to eight

<p>King Oscar II., in the jubilee year of 1897, which
marked the completion of a quarter of a century of his
reign, received innumerable proofs of the love of the two
nations under his rule and of the high esteem in which he
is held by the governments and citizens of foreign countries.
The occasion was celebrated by a large and highly successful
Scandinavian exposition at Stockholm in the summer,
Russia, with Finland, also taking part, and by a series of
festivities about September 21st, the date of his succession
to the throne. King Oscar has always given sympathetic
attention to the United States, especially to their citizens
of Swedish birth. Several deputations from America called
upon the king in the jubilee year. Among these was a
male chorus of fifty-four members, belonging to the American
Union of Swedish singers. The singers were invited
to the royal castle and received and feasted by the aged
monarch with cordial simplicity, in all royal splendor, without
any of its pomp or ceremony. To the hearty songs of
his unpretentious guests, King Oscar responded with one
of the eloquent speeches for which he is so justly famous,
assuring them that, although citizens of another land, they
were still followed by the loving interest of their mother
country and her monarch. When the singers intoned one
of the songs by Prince Gustavus, the king joined them with
his sonorous tenor voice, smilingly calling their attention
to the fact that he had not forgotten his students’ songs.
The anniversary of the seventieth birthday of Oscar II. was
celebrated January 21, 1899, a slight gloom being cast over
it on account of the temporary illness of the king. Oscar
II. fully recovered after a few months of rest and recreation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
and bears every indication of attaining the same advanced
age, with the same unimpaired activity, as his grandfather,
which would mean another decade added to the era of undisturbed
peace. Crown Prince Gustavus Adolphus, who
is yet little known in Norway, enjoys great popularity in
Sweden, where his harmonious, sagacious nature and resolute
energy are highly respected.</p>

<p>The reign of Oscar II. in Sweden has been marked by
reactionary movements in Church and State, but the king
has been in such close contact with his people that they
have recognized in him a sovereign who stands above the
parties. The king has used the conservative elements of his
country to strengthen her defences and to maintain the
Union with Norway, which have been the great goals of
his policy of peace. To sum up King Oscar’s standpoint
in the Norwegian question, he is willing to grant Norway
home rule in its fullest extent, but refuses to grant her
separate control of foreign affairs, which he considers incompatible
with the idea of the Union. In this standpoint
King Oscar is backed by the convictions of the overwhelming
majority of Swedes, who see in the dissolution of the
Union a danger to Sweden, Norway, or both countries, of
sharing the fate of unhappy Finland, which the civilized
world is now deeply deploring. The danger which menaces
the sons of Suomi has touched all Scandinavians to the
quick, and it would seem that the new century shall witness
a restoration of the Scandinavian policy. If the movement
to bring this about meets with success, it is to be
hoped that, from the start, it shall have rather the actual
wants than the ideal rights of the independent Scandinavian
states in view. From the point of view of citizens of the
United States we cannot but sympathize with a movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
which may establish a union of independent states into a
realm of imperial government, less an emperor. Let there
rather be two or three kings in the North, with one solid
union government and a common and equal defence in case
of war, than two or three foreign ministers with as many
different policies and a divided and unequal defence.</p>

a third edition was published at Windsor in 1750. J. K. Kohn’s edition
dates from 1805, founded on the works of the Swedish scholars Sotberg
and Ihre. Of later editions, the one by Professor A. Uppstrœm, of
Upsala, of 1854 to 1857, is considered to be the standard one. A fine
American edition has, in recent years, been published by Dr. G. H. Balg,
of Mayville, Wis. The history of Codex Argenteus, after once for all
being placed in the University Library of Upsala, has not been altogether
uneventful. In 1834 ten of the 187 leaves were stolen and remained
missing for twenty-three years. One of the trusted janitorial
attendants of the library had taken them in the hope of obtaining a
great sum of money for them, but later dared not dispose of them. On
his death-bed he surrendered the stolen leaves.</p></div>

it was a habit of certain branches of the old Swedish nobility to translate

followed the custom when being ennobled, Archaic spelling was
